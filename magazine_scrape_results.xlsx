1	Tom Wolfe	Back to Blood	11/1/2012	L	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/tom-wolfe-back-to-blood-review-1112	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	Published in the November 2012 issue
It's hard to ignore the man in the white suit. That's due partly to the threads and mostly to the fact that Tom Wolfe has spent the last 50 years being right about stuff.
In the '60s, Wolfe's journalism anticipated the volume of our present tense. Hyperactive, kinetic, happy to exaggerate in order to make its point. LOUD and Technicolored and TOTALLY IN YOUR FACE!!! He presciently nailed both the logic and the favored rhetoric of our infotainment age: one part cable news, one part reality television, and lots of parts talk radio.
In the '70s and '80s, Wolfe kept getting things right. He was right in observing that Americans loved and feared nothing so much as their own reflection. He predicted that divorce would come to be seen as no big deal, that men would trade in their wives as they did their cars, that they wouldn't be thought of as assholes for doing so. At the height of America's melancholia, in the gloom of the Ford and Carter years, Wolfe saw a renewed interest in the idea of American exceptionalism, in feel-good depictions of men with crew cuts performing tasks that required guts and know-how. The Right Stuff is Wolfe at his rightest. It predicts both the iconography and the themes upon which Reagan built his legacy.
Wolfe rolled out The Bonfire of the Vanities in 1987. It was his first and best work of fiction. As literature, it's nothing special. Pretty hokey stuff. However, as a guide to what New York would look like in the years after it was published, the book is mostly on target: a city in which everyone is out to grab as much money and power as they can, and to do so by whatever means necessary. Wolfe suggests that this is not only the way things are but probably the best they can be.
Right on.
But the problem with being right about so many things is that it can trick you into thinking you're right about everything. And in his new novel about Miami, Back to Blood (Little, Brown, $30), Tom Wolfe demonstrates as much by getting it wrong. As sociology, Back to Blood is about as convincing as an undergrad's term paper. As a crime novel, it's about as compelling as a Matlock re-rerun. In short, Back to Blood is wrong. Bad. Or as Wolfe would write, BAAADDD!!!!!!!
The problems are clear from the outset. Wolfe opens with a Wasp couple driving downtown to meet friends at a happening restaurant called Balzac's. This is wrong on both fronts. As in: A) There are no Wasps in Miami. And B) Finding a restaurant in Miami named after a 19th-century French novelist is about as likely as finding a bar in South Boston named Goldstein's. It could happen. But really, it just doesn't. For Wolfe, however, these considerations are beside the point. Balzac's is the name of the restaurant because Wolfe wants to invite the comparison. They are Wasps because they need to be shocked by the Latina who swipes their parking spot. Wolfe spends a lot of time in Back to Blood describing how shocked people are by one another's behavior. They are left "agog" or "sputtering." Their eyes bulge out. Perhaps this is how it goes in Wolfe's neck of the woods, but in Miami, a place where a naked man recently ate another man's face, nothing's shocking. In this town, one is shocked by the strange ways of other people only if one hasn't been here very long.
Similarly, there are no characters in Back to Blood, only caricatures, cartoonish stereotypes that are little more than reflections of their sociocultural contexts. The Cuban cop who loves his pastelitos. The preppy reporter with all the right credentials. The Hialeah honey with a heart of gold and a pussy like a papaya. In Back to Blood, Wolfe comes across as a white guy explaining brown people to a room full of white guys. Sure, he burns pages giving his readers access to these characters' interiors, but once he's given you the sociological stats (age, gender, race, occupation) there's really no need for it. Anything Wolfe tells you about what his characters are thinking are things you could've guessed from the jump. Not a one of them seems capable of an ambiguous or contradictory thought. Bankers think about money. Ball players think about ball. Astronauts think about flight. And if they are not thinking about these things, they are probably thinking about getting their dick sucked. Maybe that's how things work in the real world. You don't make lots of money without thinking about money all the time. But in the pages of Back to Blood, this kind of thing makes for an awfully long slog, a deeply unconvincing group portrait.
What Wolfe does get right  the heat, the beach, the neighborhoods  is the kind of stuff you can pick up over the course of a couple weekends. Or from Wikipedia. It's not the kind of deep reporting that Wolfe prides himself on. If it was, Wolfe would know first and foremost that Miami isn't New York. Or Atlanta. Or San Francisco. Wolfe knows this. And then again, not really, or not nearly as well as he ought.
For Wolfe, every place is the same place. It doesn't matter if it's Brooklyn or Buckhead or a college campus somewhere in North Carolina. Only the scenery changes. Wolfe has got these disparate and complex worlds all figured out. But that's easy to do when one views all worlds as a collection of monkeys pissing on monkeys, of thick-necked heroes imposing their will upon a schoolyard packed with pussies. If one doesn't see the world quite this way, it's not because the world is more varied and more complex than Wolfe would allow but rather because you yourself are pencil-necked. You've been hoodwinked by a graduate degree in the humanities. If you don't see the world Wolfe's way, Wolfe will show you. Not in the lives and happenings of fully formed characters, not in events that seem likely or even plausible, but in CAPS LOCK, in more exclamation points than you had ever thought possible.
Maybe Wolfe's right. Maybe this is the world we live in. But I'm not convinced. I don't think the world that Wolfe depicts exists anywhere outside of the elementary-school playground or maybe some superchic Manhattan boÎte called Balzac's. I imagine Wolfe has spent a lot of time considering the workings of such places. But the existence of such places does not preclude the differing realities of other places, places that play by an entirely different set of rules. Wolfe should take these terra incognitas more seriously. He should spend some time in them. Get to know them. He might learn something. Serious. The guy needs to get out more.

2	John Grisham	Calico Joe	4/1/2012	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/stephen-king-john-grisham-new-books-0412	Esquire	Benjamin Percy	Published in the April 2012 issue

The books of Stephen King and John Grisham are not read aloud by the scarved, bespectacled men you'll find in the dark corners of university coffee shops. But they  the big-armed cleanup batters of the book world  are read where it matters: everywhere else.
Grisham has slugged more than 20 books, King more than 50. And with that many at-bats, of course they strike out. But people keep buying their books, just like people keep watching Albert Pujols, because they know these men are capable of brilliance. I'm talking less about line-by-line craftsmanship  though King knows how to turn a sentence  and more about the everyman accessibility of their characters as well as their keen sense of story and structure, their plots as vivid and precise in their design as the chalk diamonding the infield.
Baseball is the subject of Grisham's latest, Calico Joe (Doubleday, $25), a novel about the Cubs and the Mets during the 1973 season, and two men whose lives will be changed by one pitch. (You can picture the movie poster already.) Grisham mixes in fictional players with the real ones, and the novel occasionally reads like the sports page of a small-town newspaper. But he makes up for it in moments like these: "He sprinted after foul balls, lunged into the stands, turned lazy singles into doubles, bunted with two strikes, violently broke up double plays, tagged up on every fly ball to the outfield, usually had the dirtiest uniform when the game was over, and through it all ripped baseballs to all corners of the field." Is the end of the book overly sentimental? Yes, grossly so. But baseball is a sentimental sport, and with spring training under way, this was exactly the reading experience I wanted.



Those familiar with the Dark Tower series know that Roland Deschain is a gunslinger  a blend of knight and U. S. marshal in a ruined, sand-swept world parallel to ours  and The Wind Through the Keyhole (Scribner, $27) begins where Wizard and Glass left off, giving us a story within a story within a story. In the Dark Tower novels, and in the Marvel comic series, I have always found Roland's formative years the most compelling, and this takes us back to the year following his mother's death. He is too young to shave but old enough to lead the hunt for a shape-shifting "skin-man" who pleasures in nighttime pursuits like ripping the heads off children and piking them on fence posts. The story reads like a genre mash-up of horror/western/detective fiction, in which our hero rides into town to wade through gore, solve a mystery, and bring justice to an unruly frontier town. The experience will further steel him for the man he will become, the stone-faced gunslinger who makes bullets dance from six-shooters with sandalwood grips.
Can you read this book as a stand-alone novel if you're unfamiliar with the Dark Tower series? Yes. Should you? Hard to say. I felt enchanted, but maybe for the same reason that I bought the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings DVDs. It is not King at his best. (For that, you should pick up Different Seasons, a book that includes "The Body"  one of the greatest coming-of-age stories ever written  and "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption," a languidly paced, bruised-hearted novella about male friendship and the good and evil that people are capable of.)
Sometimes King is great, sometimes he's merely good, and perhaps that's the point. Even when King and Grisham don't connect, there's still beauty and excitement in their swings. They still tell stories better than anyone. And they are read by millions because they tell the stories everyone can relate to  of ordinary people leading ordinary lives hurled into extraordinary circumstances. In doing so, they make you gasp, lean forward, chew the inside of your cheek. They entertain. And isn't that why we read books in the first place?

4	Derf Backderf	My Friend Dahmer	3/1/2012	S	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/jeffrey-dahmer-comic-book-0312	Esquire	Tyler Cabot	Published in the March 2012 issue

You can read the 9/11 Commission Report in comic-book form. And the U.S. Constitution. Even the biography of Anne Frank. The latest subject in the genre is mass murderer Jeffrey Dahmer. In My Friend Dahmer (Abrams, $25), written by his high school acquaintance Derf Backderf, you can see Dahmer made fun of as a troubled teenager while he staggers drunk through high school and fakes having seizures to amuse his small circle of "friends," who tolerate him so they can laugh at him. You can also see Dahmer placing dead animals in jars of acid and taking the ugly girl to the prom.
Backderf offers a stern admonition on the third-to-last page in case you got the wrong idea in the previous 200 and thought it was all about laughs: "The premise of this book is that Dahmer was a tragic figure, but that only applies up until the moment he kills. After that horrible day in June 1978, the only tragedy is that Dahmer didn't have the courage to put a gun to his head and end it."
The hallmark of this rapidly growing subgenre has been transforming complex and important stories into more accessible and entertaining forms. My Friend Dahmer takes something light, high school gossip, and transforms it into something lighter  then warns you not to take it so lightly.

You almost always have to defend yourself when you tell people that you're reading a new tough-guy novel. People look at you as though you lack seriousness when you profess enthusiasm for writers whose novels depend on plot, whose main characters recur again and again, and who write violence artfully. These are not "crime" novels or "mysteries" or "thrillers"  they don't fit into any Kindle categorization. They are books that have grown for the last 80 years from seeds planted by Hammett and Chandler out of a uniquely American soil, and they each taste a little different, depending on the region from which they come. This fall's red harvest is rich. Last month, we made glowing mention of James Lee Burke's new novel, Feast Day of Fools (Simon & Schuster, $27), which has been the occasion of an outpouring of critical love  perhaps because Burke is now in his 70s and people are starting to realize how much poorer our literary landscape will be if he ever passes. And then came a new book and a new protagonist from George Pelecanos. Then a new Jack Reacher from Lee Child. And then a new Hieronymus Bosch from Michael Connelly. Burke is from the Gulf Coast, Pelecanos is from D. C., Connelly is of Los Angeles, and Child (a Brit who adopted America as well as its only original literary genre) writes from what he hopes and imagines the United States to be. Their protagonists are the same kind of me  tough guys  and everything else is up for grabs. Pelecanos introduces us to Spero Lucas, and within a single chapter of The Cut (Reagan Arthur Books, $26), we know who he is  Iraq vet, loner, Greek. No one draws character like Pelecanos  which is what makes him useful as a scriptwriter for shows like The Wire and Treme. And no one, no writer of any kind, writes D. C. with the kind of affection that Pelecanos does. Even if you've eaten a half-smoke and were disappointed by it, you're eager to give Ben's Chili Bowl a second chance. The city  in its roiling diversity, both ethnic and criminal  provides Pelecanos endless opportunities for original plotting. And the fresh protagonist has energized his writing: Lucas is a new generation of badass--young, on the make, just out of the military, liberated from any conventional moral code, beholden to no one other than his brother and his mom. This is Connelly's 15th book starring Bosch, an LAPD detective. The Drop (Little, Brown, $28), like its predecessor, Nine Dragons, is complicated and profoundly dark. Even as Connelly's other star protagonist, Mickey Haller, has suffered through a fame-induced lull (McConaughey tried to play him this past spring), Bosch remains a conflicted, committed, tortured man, navigating both the maze of LAPD political infighting and the depravity of human nature. Oh, and trying to raise the daughter whose mother was brutally murdered in Nine Dragons. And through all the intricacies of plot  and there are many, as Bosch works both the murder/suicide of a politician's son and a cold murder case that appears to indict an eight-year-old boy  The Drop makes you long for the taco trucks of East L. A. and the late-night view from up on Mulholland Drive.Across the books of all these writers, there is a growing sense of vigilantism. As their characters age, they are more willing to act as the final arbiter, remaining within the bounds of their own code but with less and less regard for details like the law or established hierarchy. They mete out their own version of justice so that they are certain that justice will be served. None more so than Reacher. One of the mysteries of Child's Jack Reacher has long been how he made the transition from enforcing the law of the U. S. Army as a military police investigator to wandering the backroads of America, enforcing his own idea of right. The Affair (Delacorte Press, $28) takes us back in time to Reacher's final investigation as an MP  the murders of beautiful young women just outside the fence of an Army base in rural Mississippi. And in this historical interlude, Reacher crosses a line, imposing a punishment that makes it clear that he has gone rogue and can be beholden to no authority larger than himself. Each of these guys writes a lot. They are our most prolific authors. You worry about exhaustion, in terms of both their originality and their interest in their own characters. In each case this fall, these books are a renewal and an argument for the continued vitality of the genre.

A. and the late-night view from up on Mulholland Drive.Across the books of all these writers, there is a growing sense of vigilantism. As their characters age, they are more willing to act as the final arbiter, remaining within the bounds of their own code but with less and less regard for details like the law or established hierarchy. They mete out their own version of justice so that they are certain that justice will be served. None more so than Reacher. One of the mysteries of Child's Jack Reacher has long been how he made the transition from enforcing the law of the U. S. Army as a military police investigator to wandering the backroads of America, enforcing his own idea of right. The Affair (Delacorte Press, $28) takes us back in time to Reacher's final investigation as an MP  the murders of beautiful young women just outside the fence of an Army base in rural Mississippi. And in this historical interlude, Reacher crosses a line, imposing a punishment that makes it clear that he has gone rogue and can be beholden to no authority larger than himself. Each of these guys writes a lot. They are our most prolific authors. You worry about exhaustion, in terms of both their originality and their interest in their own characters. In each case this fall, these books are a renewal and an argument for the continued vitality of the genre.
9	Colson Whitehead	Zone One	9/1/2011	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/zone-one-review-1011	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	I was born in pre-zombie America, before 1968, which marked the debut of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, a crafty B movie now widely considered to be Year Zero for the shambling, flesh-eating undead in American popular culture. Sure, zombies are ubiquitous  evinced in feature films, comic books, graphic novels, cable series  but they aren't ancient archetypes. I have an electric fan in my basement far older than any movie zombie. Works great, too, though I'm not sure you can say the same about that first Romero movie. Maybe that's why they rewired it, retooled it, remade it dozens upon dozens of times over the years. Most recently in the form of a serious novel, Zone One (Doubleday, $26), by Colson Whitehead.Opening in the wake of the inciting pandemic, Zone One casts its gaze on the weirdly named Mark Spitz, once a knowledgeable, vaguely hip, somewhat covetous New Yorker, now a civilian soldier in the post-plague recolonization of Manhattan. Spitz wanders through an ash-covered city where the infected are often mistaken for the devastated, who suffer from Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder. Thousands are dead, but irony lives. Mark Spitz dreams about a yoga class at which a "skel"  as the infected are called  snaps in half at the waist, and no one comments. Later he watches torrents of skels stream upward, a liquid mass indistinguishable from one another, in advance of disaster. It's always been hard to care about Whitehead's blend of hip cultural detailing, unusually mannered observation, and vaguely pointed social commentary. Sag Harbor, his recent semi-autobiographical novel, is a snoozy summer tale of rich kids dealing with racial dynamics on a beach, groping for a stake in who-cares America. What it possesses in authenticity, it lacks in urgency, pace, acuity of imagined detail. Problem solved. Zone One marks the arrival of Whitehead's real narrative engine. He's telling a story  tumble down, mired in the wreckage of the world we currently pretend to cherish. It's a book you want to read rather than one you should read. Sure, there are familiar paradigms: the pandemic subsides behind a foreground of chase scenes, us-or-them admonitions, even the occasional bite sequence. But Zone One is mercilessly free of cookie-cutter social commentaries  office culture is for mindless drones; technology destroys our ability to connect  while still providing the chilling, fleshy pleasures of zombies who lurch, pursue, hunger. This isn't Colson Whitehead taking preening batting-practice swings for the amusement of a twitterized fan base. He's a writer considering the demons of a people, writing a novel describing transformation  his own, from beloved New York semi-flaneur to the blacksmith of a myth that outlasts a movie season. In Whitehead's suddenly sure hands this is a stressed nation blinking its eyes in the dim light of a train platform, or a farm, or a ruined city, working to distinguish who might be there to do us harm.  You don't need to have lived through a lifetime of movies about zombies or a single showing of An Inconvenient Truth to understand that Zone One formulates an essential equation: the measure of what we once had versus the hint of what we have left. Whitehead brilliantly reformulates an old-hat genre to ask the epidemic question of a teetering history  the question about the possibility of survival. What makes Zone One one of the best books of the year is that the answer is the skels' and ours alike.

Feast Day of Fools (Simon & Schuster, $27), by James Lee Burke
You'll be absorbed by the heat lightning and alkali flats and creosote and stovepipe cacti that define this southwest Texas border town and beckon the dead and beaten. You'll be silenced by the ghosts and mind readers and coyotes who smuggle illegals, and the scar-face killer named Preacher Jack Collins, who totes his Thompson machine gun in a guitar case. And you'll pull for Sheriff Hackberry Holland, a soft man who won't break  ever  who contends with the dead bodies strewn across the desert by Collins and also by the Feds and evangelical freedom fighters and Russians and Mexicans and Al Qaeda. Because everyone is hunting or hunted. Because there aren't enough Sheriff Hollands in the world. Because holy shit does this novel crush into its pages a whole war chest of bloody drama and brutal questions about what it means to be an American and a Christian and a Christian American in the new century. And because James Lee Burke  muscular and elegiac, brutal and compassionate  is a Stetson-wearing, spur-jangling giant among novelists. Benjamin Percy

11	James Boice	The Good and the Ghastly	5/1/2011	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/best-new-books-0511	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	If I never read another novel about New York, inky with the bio of the newly minted M.F.A. describing the lively commerce of the slouching, wag-waisted populace of that writer's inner circle, I might still believe in the breadth and depth of that great city. Once, it seemed the novel form might just be mutable enough to be reinvented, not merely repeated, in the hands of the young, the angry, the arrogant. The very compact of the endeavor seemed to include the possibility that books could be written to blow up, reassemble, even replace the ideas of books that came before them. 


James Boice and Patrick deWitt seem to remember that charge. Their new books  Boice's The Good and the Ghastly (Scribner, $24) and deWitt's The Sisters Brothers (Ecco, $25)  still do the underappreciated craftwork of making a good story first. Boice leans into a purposefully bland, postapocalyptic future, 13 centuries hence, while deWitt reposits the western as a lucid dream chase, log-piled with the opiated citizens of a world two centuries gone. One looks forward, the other back. At some core level, each is a thrilling revenge story, punctuated by signature violence that feels both hyperbolic and routine. In this, they are somewhat alike. And while this is not meant to be a comparison/contrast, maybe it should be. These are great books, new books, books that speak broadly to what we want from a novel, and more specifically to what we should demand from emergent writers  reformulation, reinvention  something new about the world beyond them. Boice's The Good and the Ghastly is your standard bildungsroman, slipped into the dystopic 34th century, a time when everything is owned by Visa, when deer have become house pets, and Bob Dylan is misremembered as an assassin. The conflict between a rising gangster and a vigilante mother who pursues him is open and epic in its curve. The prose, ringingly clear, sometimes maddeningly flat, is always well footed. As in his first novel, MVP, about a basketball star with a striking similarity to Kobe Bryant, Boice deals a somewhat slight, often sly variation on the world we live in now, so that even the money we spend on it may be a kind of ticket to a half hell we're reading about. It hasn't happened yet, but the book lives.DeWitt, looking back, unspools a lushly voiced picaresque story. A frontier chase, dark in tone and music, all flickering oil lamps and horse hooves in the dark, a place where murder is like climbing a fence, tricky but doable, and the mind is the juiciest piece of technology anyone can get their hands on, morphine the software that bends it. It's a kind of True Grit told by Tom Waits. Two brothers with the last name Sisters are sent to kill a man named Warm, to pursue him for their shadowy maker, known only as the Commodore, across the West. At first glance, this too could be mistaken for a plainer version of the now, but it's so richly told, so detailed, that what emerges is a weird circus of existence, all steel shanks and ponies, gut shots and medication poured into the eyeholes of the dying. At some level, this too is a kind of revenge story, marvelously blurry. That time is gone, yet there it is, alive and nasty in its compassionate grip on things.Boice's distant future feels wholly like the now. DeWitt's recent past creates its own lurid present. Murder and revenge, satire and adventure. Maybe nothing new is really new. Just blown up, remade, reinvented.

14	David Foster Wallace	The Pale King	3/1/2011	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/the-pale-king-review-0411-5402611	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	Published in the April 2011 issue

The last work of fiction by the greatest American writer of my generation is an incomplete and weirdly fractured pseudo memoir about the United States tax code and several employees of the Internal Revenue Service. The work is frustratingly difficult in places. It's potholed throughout by narrative false starts and dead ends. Characters appear without introduction and disappear without cause. I often found myself putting the novel down, and I didn't always want to pick it up again. Then I did. Because The Pale King, an unfinished manuscript that will be published this month by Little, Brown, is one of the saddest and most lovely books I've ever read.  This sadness, of course, has something (or probably a lot) to do with David Foster Wallace's suicide by hanging in 2008. With lots of exceptions, killing yourself is a bad idea. It's a particularly bad idea for writers. First, you run the risk of turning all your prior efforts into one long suicide note. What's worse, especially if you're a writer as beloved as Wallace, is that you may be turned into some kind of icon. And, as D.F.W. himself once wrote, "to make someone an icon is to make him an abstraction, and abstractions are incapable of vital communication with living people."So, yes, part of my reaction to The Pale King is an echo of the reaction I had when I learned of D.F.W.'s suicide. Something along the lines of: Oh, come on! Why'd he do that? Really? I wish he hadn't done that. Why'd he do that? I'm not including this here because I think this is some kind of profound reaction. I'm including it because if you read The Pale King, this is a reaction you can expect to have often.  And let's state this clearly: You should read The Pale King.You don't have to read it in a couple days or even a couple months. I'm not sure you even need to read it in any particular order. It's not that kind of book. If it keeps you up at night, it won't be because you've got to know what happens next. If you're up, you'll be up because D.F.W. writes sentences and sometimes whole pages that make you feel like you can't breathe. You'll be up because again and again he invites you to consider some very heavy things  like what it means to consider heavy things and how we go about deciding what's worth our consideration. The Pale King asks you, for instance, why it is that you haven't spent more time considering the morality of our tax code. It asks what it means to be a citizen of Grand Rapids, Michigan, or Beloit, Wisconsin, or Peoria, Illinois, and whether being an American really means anything at all. But perhaps you could care less about citizenship. Fine. Though if that's the case, you'll be invited to consider how this came to be. And you'll be asked to consider other, still more difficult things that you might prefer not to consider at all. Like the ways you treat those whom you profess to love. The ways in which you have failed them. Can you make amends? I mean for real. I mean serious. Do you believe that wounds ever heal? Can things gone wrong be made right? And what of all those whom you should love and do not? The sweaty kid in the back of your geometry class. The wastoids with whom you've lost touch. Have you even tried to love them? Have you tried hard enough? And how would you know and what would that mean?Throughout The Pale King Wallace asks these questions of us. Or rather through some function of his genius, he causes us to ask these questions of ourselves. Fortunately, you don't have to answer these questions now. Unfortunately, you do have to answer them soon. The Pale King is the kind of novel that will wait until you're ready. Take it slow. That's how I'm going to read it the next time  five to ten pages at a time  real careful. I'm going to stretch it out, make it last, because it's all we're going to get from someone I wish had stuck around.


More David Foster Wallace:Fifteen years later, Wallace's  Infinite Jest  still impresses and inspires. One is struck increasingly by the Whitmanesque generosity of the novel's spirit, the sweet, smart break of its heart.  D.F.W.'s nonfiction, much of it collected in  Consider the Lobster,  is obsessive, erudite, and charming. His suicide cast a particularly long shadow here  how could a writer so relentlessly curious about this world opt to leave it so early?  If Infinite Jest is the zig,  Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,  a collection of short fiction, represents the zag. This is Wallace at his darkest, and most challenging. Also, his funniest. Fiercely moral without ever turning moralistic.

15	Jonathan Franzen	Freedom	8/1/2010	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/jonathan-franzen-freedom-review-0910	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	The first thing people are going to want to know about Jonathan Franzen's new novel, Freedom (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $28) is if it measures up to Franzen's last novel, The Corrections. It measures up. In fact, if you liked The Corrections, you may like Freedom even better. Or not quite so much. It doesn't matter. Some like Sticky Fingers and others like Exile. Some say Bird. Others say Magic. These are fun arguments,1 but they're not important ones. The important thing is that The Corrections is a great novel. So is Freedom.Great isn't a term much associated with American novels these days. That's partly because so many Americans have given up on big books.2 But it's also because many of our writers have given up on the very notion of greatness. Franzen hasn't. David Foster Wallace may have cashed in his chips, but Franzen isn't just hanging in, he's doubling down. And so Freedom kicks against the pricks like a thing intent on being. Whatever else Freedom is, it's a great slab of a book. Check out the specs: 576 pages (small font, tight spacing). Check out the sweep: a large cast of intergenerational characters, a narrative that covers more than 30 years and engages issues ranging from the influence of Big Coal on our politics to the way sex can both create love and destroy it. This is a book that acts as though people still had long conversations, still read long books.  This makes Franzen a writer deeply at odds with his times. While his contemporaries content themselves with small books about nothing much or big books about comics, Franzen delivers the massive, old-school jams. It's not that Franzen's prose makes other writers seem untalented; it's that he makes them seem so lazy, so irrelevant, so lacking in the kind of chutzpah we once expected from our best authors. Freedom doesn't name check War and Peace for nothing. It's making a claim for shelf space among the kind of books that the big dogs used to write. The kind they called important. The kind they called greats.Is all this talk of greatness hopelessly out of touch? Probably. The Great American Novel has likely gone the way of the Great American Radio Drama. But I hope not. I hope that books like Freedom will still play a role in the culture, still engage us in a serious conversation about the anachronistic things that matter most  our families, our lovers, our country, our planet. Freedom reminds us just how much these things matter, reminds us that they matter more than Scotch and jeans and Jake Gyllenhaal. It lets us know that these things are worth thinking and fighting and maybe even reading about.3

1. Correct answers: Let It Bleed and Jordan.2. According to an Associated Press-Ipsos poll, in one year, the typical American reads four books. One in four adults reads none.3.

											If it's still possible to be an important novelist, Don DeLillo is one. He's also one of those rare writers whose work has transcended literary circles and touched the wider culture. In White Noise, he presented our lives as media saturated well before the intrusions of the 24/7 news cycle. In Mao II, he seemed to predict the coming age of terror with its "midair explosions and crumbled buildings." If DeLillo hadn't coined the phrase "Airborne Toxic Event," we would've had to invent it. For these and lots of other good reasons, DeLillo is often portrayed as more than a writer  he's become a kind of secular prophet. But the problem with prophets is that they're easy to admire and hard to love. And on some level, we've got to love our novelists. They ask a lot of us. In return, I think we have the right to expect that they deliver some kind of pleasure. That's what novels are at their base  pleasure machines. This isn't to say that their pleasures should come cheap  we're already drowning in amusements. Still, the pleasures must be real.In DeLillo's most recent novel, Point Omega (Scribner, $24), the prophecy comes by way of Richard Elster, an aging intellectual who has helped "conceptualize" the war in Iraq. We join Elster and a young filmmaker somewhere in the American desert, where Elster has gone to escape the "nausea of News and Traffic." The filmmaker wants Elster to make a movie with him  no cuts, no artificial lighting, just Elster talking to the camera. Elster in return tells us that "Iraq is a whisper" of the serious catastrophes to come. He says that "consciousness is exhausted" and that "we want to be the dead matter we used to be." At times, these conversations border on the Scandinavian. From their bleak perch, the characters speak in fragmented truisms that sound like excerpts from more fully developed philosophical positions. If there's an overarching argument to what Elster says, it seems to be that it's "time to close it all down." But prophets are always saying that, and somehow we manage to keep on keeping on. While I'll always admire DeLillo, I don't think I've enjoyed reading him since the rightly famous opening of 1997's Underworld. Since then it's been too much medicine and not enough sugar. Maybe that's the point. Maybe DeLillo is arguing that our prediabetic asses don't deserve any more sweets, no respite from our well-earned sufferings. He wouldn't be the first prophet, or novelist, to have said as much. The problem with this position is that it doesn't leave much incentive to read him. Our best novelists don't shy away from our prognosis  terminal, totally terminal  but they don't allow the dire forecast to blind them to the complexity of our present moment. And if you go back to DeLillo's earlier work  White Noise or Great Jones Street or Ratner's Star  you'll be struck by the laughs that accompany the impending doom. This is gallows humor for sure, but humor nonetheless. The mature DeLillo, by contrast, is maybe a little ripe. Amidst all the high seriousness, I miss the high ironies.

20	Stephen King	Under the Dome	11/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/stephen-king-under-the-dome-1109	Esquire	Benjamin Percy	Stephen King once called himself the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries. And yeah, that makes a kind of sense to the millions and millions served who have gobbled their way through one of his novels only to head straight back to the bookstore starved for more. But King sells himself short  as do literary critics the world over. What they see is a blood-soaked popular novelist who employs plot and its parent condition, entertainment, a dirty word to them. What they overlook is an author who transcends his genre by channeling our cultural fears better than nearly any American author. Look to the industrial horrors of "Graveyard Shift," the bioterror of The Stand, the cold-war anxiety of The Dead Zone. Anyone who doubts King's chops has simply not read enough of him, not read his O. Henry prize-winning story, "The Man in the Black Suit," his novella The Body, nor his novels The Gunslinger, The Green Mile, Lisey's Story.His latest, 1,088-page tome, Under the Dome (Scribner, $35), hews to the classic King formula: A community is isolated, a force of horror is introduced. In this case, Chester's Mill, Maine, is sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes and helicopters and cars and birds crash into it. A gardener's hand is severed by it. Bullets whiz off it. So do missiles. No one knows where it came from  whether it is supernatural, a military experiment, or an act of terrorism. The real focus is not the dome, of course, but what happens beneath it, the "orderless, reasonless beast that can arise when frightened people are provoked." King's ability to create a gripping world is so great, his pacing so effortlessly swift, that it can feel as if you're caught in a cat's claws, at once fearful of and delighted by the horrors the next page might bring. Often that horror is trained on a war vet turned line cook who goes by the nickname Barbie. He is our doorway to 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, waterboarding. Look to contemporary horror movies like Hostel, Saw, Wolf Creek, The Devil's Rejects  all of them spotlighting abduction, rape, torture, dismemberment  and you can understand them as offspring of the war on terror. The world under the dome is born of the same caul, but it's infinitely more sophisticated, because King knows that the biggest danger comes not from the outside  from bombs, from war, from Islam  but from the mob growing within. We are all under the dome. No, not a Big Mac and fries. A more fitting analogy is country music: The critics never love it, never give it the respect it deserves, yet the genre prospers, constantly evolving and reinventing its sound with the times, always moored to working people  and the fear and anxiety that are as ingrained in American culture as aspiration.

21	Colum McCann	Let the Great World Spin	7/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/let-the-great-world-spin-book-review-0809	Esquire	Tom Junod	We are familiar by now with the 9/11 novel  with the idea of it, anyway. Before the bone fragments were harvested from Ground Zero, or any of the accidental monuments desanctified by their eventual inclusion in a Staten Island landfill, writers of American fiction were challenged to write about the Day Everything Changed. And yet the dream of a novel that unifies the culture around an event that wound up cleaving it is just another of those things that hasn't quite worked out for this country in the Un-American Century. For the most part, American readers have rejected the notion that any one writer can tell them about an event they had to live through. The narrative of the Un-American Century is that there is no central narrative, and, thanks to the self-expanding and story-diminishing technology available on the Internet, that's how we like it.Now into this landscape comes a book that is not a 9/11 novel or a post-9/11 novel, but rather a pre-9/11 novel. Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin (Random House, $25) takes place on August 7, 1974, the day that Philippe Petit walked on a high wire between the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, then freshly erupted and now forever effaced. Save for a rueful coda set in 2006, it is a novel about beginnings rather than endings, and yet, like downtown New York itself, it is shadowed by a shadow no longer there, and one can scarcely imagine it being written without that opportunity for rue. Indeed, Let the Great World Spin is a birth certificate chiseled on a tombstone, and, as such, it's not so much a historical novel as it is a novel about history  about how it works. As he did in his great Dancer, in which he managed to rewrite the Russian novel through the rebellion of Rudolf Nureyev, McCann uses Let the Great World Spin to strand a wide cast of characters between gravity and grace and to make each member of a historical chorus sing all alone. His method, which he has practiced in novel after novel and is now all his own, is to find a figure who offers the image of perfect freedom  who seems beyond history itself  and then to use that figure to deliver his characters to their fates.Let the Great World Spin is not Man on Wire; it is not the story of Philippe Petit, whom McCann inhabits but never names; not the story of another dancer suspended, by force of miracle, in thin air. Rather it is the story of the people on the ground and what it is like to be implicated in a freedom they can never attain. McCann's great accomplishment here is not only to identify August 7, 1974, as the beginning of an era of American freedom that ended on September 11, 2001, not only to suggest how the end of that era was prefigured in the beginning, and the fall in the rise. No, it's to forgive the fall, almost preemptively, and on that score, Let the Great World Spin stands as a kind of corrective to Don DeLillo's remorselessly precise and punishing Falling Man. Call it Floating Man, for it is a book so humane in its understanding of original sin that it winds up bestowing what might be called original absolution, and it is a pre-9/11 novel that delivers the sense that so many of the 9/11 novels have missed: We are all dancing on the wire of history, and even on solid ground we breathe the thinnest of air.

25	Dean Koontz	Relentless	6/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/dean-koontz-david-baldacci-0709	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	I've never read a novel by Nicholas Sparks for the same reason I've never seen a movie starring Ashton Kutcher: because I'm stupid, yeah, but I'm not that stupid. But the problem with avoiding stupid books is that you end up avoiding the books that people actually read. This makes you feel out of touch. Like one of those elitist wimps whom fat guys on the radio are always making fun of. So I read some of them: Relentless, by Dean Koontz (Bantam); Long Lost, by Harlan Coben (Dutton); and First Family, by David Baldacci (Grand Central). And it hurt. Since I'm never going to do it again, and since I don't recommend that anybody else try this shit at home, here's what I learned from reading these stupid books.
1. The world is batshit insane. One of the complaints that gets leveled against contemporary literary fiction is that nothing happens. Rich girls stare out windows and think sad thoughts. Old men stare at rich girls and think sad thoughts. On the other hand, in Koontz's Relentless, the nation's most prominent book reviewer (huh?) is a serial killer in a bow tie, and major plots hinge on the ability of dogs to teleport. Coben's significantly more credible effort features the diabolic interplay of cord blood and Islamic jihad, while Baldacci busies himself with a First Lady who is also well, I don't want to ruin it. 
2. The world is not only batshit insane; it's after you. According to Koontz, the people most relentlessly after you are: a) the media (need I say more? Koontz doesn't) and b) the intellectuals, specifically Rousseau, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy. It's not that these people are going to kill you; it's that they've made the world safe for the unspecified liberal elites who will. What's a dummy to do about this? Nothing much. 
3. Women are "smart," "witty," and "graceful." They are also, quite inexplicably, in love with you, you old coot. In fact, nearly everybody who is in any way good or human is in love with you. Even though your jokes suck. Even though you are kind of an ass. Also, you may "sleep together," you may describe the way in which "your heart pounds against your rib cage and your pulse races and your knees go weak " But no fucking allowed. It's about love, man. 
4. Stupid books take almost as long to read as not-so-stupid books. The chapters are short, the dialogue is "snappy," and still things go on forever. There's a reason only very special episodes of CSI stretch past the hour mark. These books are interminable  imagine a poorly produced thriller starring Tim Allen or Jim Belushi that lasts something like 12 to 15 hours.This is the point where I'm supposed to find something positive to say about these books. That's how it works. You're supposed to get all counterintuitive and say that Sarah Palin is so freakishly stupid, she's actually some kind of genius. Here's what I can say: The Coben is not quite as bad as the Baldacci, which is not as god-awful as the Koontz. It seems it's widely considered bad form to call stupid things stupid. But that's mostly what these books are. They'll cost you $25 a pop, waste a half day of your life, and leave you neither smarter nor happier, just kind of bored and a little depressed. That's no way to spend a summer. Screw these books. Take a walk.

28	Ron Carlson	The Signal	4/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/best-summer-books-0509	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	Everybody says men don't read novels anymore. I tell them that's why so many men are asses. Good novels don't just describe the lives of men; they make arguments about the kind of men we ought to be. They inspire improvement. Would anyone still subject themselves to the embarrassments of fly-fishing if it weren't for Hemingway? Read enough Steinbeck before a certain age and you're unlikely to vote Republican. I've seen functionally illiterate undergrads read themselves right out of college. (Parents: Keep the kids far away from anything by Wendell Berry. Or worse  William Burroughs.)  The same still holds true today. Read Ron Carlson's latest, The Signal (Viking, $24), and you'll be convinced that the answer to your worries resides in the woods, in getting back to the basics: cooking over a fire, sleeping under stars, working with your hands. It's a sweet, tidy little book about a broken rancher. And yet it won't just help you pass the time; it will help you out. These three will help you out even more.Road Dogs,      by Elmore Leonard (William Morrow, $27) The chief pleasure of Leonard is that the line between the good life  money, women, drink, food and the bad life  prison, poverty, pain  is so clearly and sharply drawn. As in Out of Sight, the hero here is Jack Foley, who has no equal when it comes to robbing banks. He walks in and asks the teller politely for cash. That's it. His success (127 banks and counting) stands as a testament to the simple power of a guy who knows how to smile and remembers his p's and q's.Nothing in Road Dogs is going to make you reexamine your existential underpinnings. Leonard's more interested in sprucing up your conduct. And like all good advice, his book ultimately tells us what we already know: The world may be a cosmic joke, but that doesn't mean it's without meaningful pleasures. A good hot shower, a new white T-shirt, a rib-eye steak, a fifth of Jack Daniels  these are things for which one should be profoundly grateful. And if this seems too easy, just remember that "thinking too much can fuck you up."How to Sell,   by Clancy Martin (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $24)In some ways, the first novel from Martin is standard coming-of-age fare. Bobby Clark moves to Fort Worth, Texas, to join the retail jewelry racket. He meets a girl. He loses a girl. He makes some money. He loses some money. But where Martin's novel departs is that once Bobby's learned how to sell, there's not much else worth learning. Martin is less interested in telling us who we ought to be than he is in showing us who we've become: men (and women) ruled by wealth and the desire for wealth, sex and the desire for sex, drugs and the desire for more drugs. This is "Morning in America" as apocalyptic hangover. It's a lean and mean book, perfect for those who distrust all this recent talk about change. The kind of novel  cool and dark  that goes with you to the beach and then keeps you thinking at night. Plus it offers a handy litmus test: If its characters seem familiar, you ought to be afraid. Better still, you might consider a move to the country.Waveland,    by Frederick Barthelme (Doubleday, $25) Vaughn Williams will be familiar to fans of aging-white-guy ennui. His marriage has gone bust. His career isn't what he thought it would be, and his parents have recently died. He takes up with a woman who may have shot her husband. The two move in with his ex-wife. But these plot points aren't played for drama. Rather they are presented as sad inevitabilities. Like hurricanes. Vaughn responds to events around him the way many of us do  by thinking lots and doing little. Then something interesting happens: The old guy changes. He does the kind of simple things that we ought to do and too often do not. He stops searching for new tragedies on the Internet. He sells the big house in town. He becomes, just as old Leonard would have us be, a "sampler of ordinary pleasures."The pleasures of reading Barthelme are small. They come at the sentence level, but they are sublime. There are no grand gestures here. No profundity of insight or heroic speeches. It's too late for these things. In Waveland, things are broken nearly beyond repair. And yet the operative word here is nearly. Amid the rubble, Barthelme seems to argue, we might still find a separate peace from the terrors of the wider world. We might carve out our own thin slice of sanity. We might turn our cruel selves kinder. We might be mostly lousy, but we can improve. Plus One Book for Your SonRead Chuck Palahniuk's new book, Pygmy (Doubleday, $25), and you'll learn to despise the hypocrisy of born-again Christians. Already got that covered? Okay, instead give Pygmy to your kid. He'll think you're rad. Palahniuk's perfect for the little one because he delivers the surface kicks of Burroughs without the danger of any actual subversion. Your boy may get a bad haircut. He probably won't start in on the smack.

31	Frederick Barthelme	Waveland	4/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/best-summer-books-0509	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	Everybody says men don't read novels anymore. I tell them that's why so many men are asses. Good novels don't just describe the lives of men; they make arguments about the kind of men we ought to be. They inspire improvement. Would anyone still subject themselves to the embarrassments of fly-fishing if it weren't for Hemingway? Read enough Steinbeck before a certain age and you're unlikely to vote Republican. I've seen functionally illiterate undergrads read themselves right out of college. (Parents: Keep the kids far away from anything by Wendell Berry. Or worse  William Burroughs.)  The same still holds true today. Read Ron Carlson's latest, The Signal (Viking, $24), and you'll be convinced that the answer to your worries resides in the woods, in getting back to the basics: cooking over a fire, sleeping under stars, working with your hands. It's a sweet, tidy little book about a broken rancher. And yet it won't just help you pass the time; it will help you out. These three will help you out even more.Road Dogs,      by Elmore Leonard (William Morrow, $27) The chief pleasure of Leonard is that the line between the good life  money, women, drink, food and the bad life  prison, poverty, pain  is so clearly and sharply drawn. As in Out of Sight, the hero here is Jack Foley, who has no equal when it comes to robbing banks. He walks in and asks the teller politely for cash. That's it. His success (127 banks and counting) stands as a testament to the simple power of a guy who knows how to smile and remembers his p's and q's.Nothing in Road Dogs is going to make you reexamine your existential underpinnings. Leonard's more interested in sprucing up your conduct. And like all good advice, his book ultimately tells us what we already know: The world may be a cosmic joke, but that doesn't mean it's without meaningful pleasures. A good hot shower, a new white T-shirt, a rib-eye steak, a fifth of Jack Daniels  these are things for which one should be profoundly grateful. And if this seems too easy, just remember that "thinking too much can fuck you up."How to Sell,   by Clancy Martin (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $24)In some ways, the first novel from Martin is standard coming-of-age fare. Bobby Clark moves to Fort Worth, Texas, to join the retail jewelry racket. He meets a girl. He loses a girl. He makes some money. He loses some money. But where Martin's novel departs is that once Bobby's learned how to sell, there's not much else worth learning. Martin is less interested in telling us who we ought to be than he is in showing us who we've become: men (and women) ruled by wealth and the desire for wealth, sex and the desire for sex, drugs and the desire for more drugs. This is "Morning in America" as apocalyptic hangover. It's a lean and mean book, perfect for those who distrust all this recent talk about change. The kind of novel  cool and dark  that goes with you to the beach and then keeps you thinking at night. Plus it offers a handy litmus test: If its characters seem familiar, you ought to be afraid. Better still, you might consider a move to the country.Waveland,    by Frederick Barthelme (Doubleday, $25) Vaughn Williams will be familiar to fans of aging-white-guy ennui.

33	Colson Whitehead	Sag Harbor	3/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/colson-whitehead-sag-harbor-0409	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	Everybody digs Colson Whitehead. Since we're talking literary fiction here, let it be understood that when I say everybody, I mean hardly anyone. I mean aging former English majors who wear bookish specs. I mean editors at The New Yorker and reviewers at The New York Times. Try to find a bad review. Google your eyes out. Even when heavyweights criticize his work, they also go to great lengths to assure their readers that they very much dig the author. If you suspect I'm jealous of Whitehead, I am; these words should be printed in green. You should be, too. Are you quite so universally admired? Were you proclaimed a genius by the folks at MacArthur before you turned 35? Besides, have you ever seen Colson Whitehead? He looks the way many of us would like our 21st-century American novelists to look: lean and dark. A snappy dresser with excellent dreads. Damn. He looks the way I'd like to look. And, oh yeah, he writes good books. I liked his first one, The Intuitionist, best, but then that's how it goes with most writers. In subsequent novels, he hooked me with the idea and then lost me in the execution. Still, the ideas are reliably provocative: How would a hack freelancer make sense of John Henry (John Henry Days)? What does it mean to name a thing in a time when so many things are not what they claim (Apex Hides the Hurt)? Here's a writer who recognizably lives in the world we live in and yet always manages to render this world anew. His latest novel, Sag Harbor (Doubleday, $25), tracks the daily activities of a group of bored black teenagers on summer vacation in the Hamptons, on Long Island. They name-check the Smiths. They roller-skate. They even frequent the bar-mitzvah circuit. Sag Harbor seems like an important book because it contributes to the upending of our (white) notions of what it means to be African-American. Like Whitehead, these kids are cool and post-racial. They harbor a certain sense of detachment, a wariness of conflict, and a rational embrace of ambiguity.This is precisely the tendency that makes Whitehead's work less engaging than it could be. He seems post-conflicted, awfully comfy in whatever skin he's in. Racial prejudice? It's out there. But it's out there like bad weather: It comes and goes and does little damage to the soul. The same goes for consumerism. And the decline of industry. Everything is cool. Which is to say that nothing is. I suppose that kind of worldview is an essential part of being cool in the first place, but I'm not sure that it's the essence of gripping literature. Doesn't the novel demand conflict? Man versus Man. Man versus Nature. Man versus Himself. The post-conflicted male, I dig him. The post-conflicted novelist? Eh. He leaves me a little cold.We're all set on the kind of well-written novels that risk nothing, offend no one, and allow book clubs to hum along on the fumes of white wine and amiable consensus. What we could use more of are books that confront us with frightening visions, evangelical zeal, wild beauty, an alarming lack of cool self-possession. Roberto Bolaño is well loved these days for lots of good reasons. But chief among them is that he reminds us that writers might be motivated by something larger than themselves, some vision of the world in which our aesthetics are inexorably tied to our politics, and our politics are inexorably tied to everything else. He writes as though he's never heard of Marion Ettlinger. Everybody digs Colson Whitehead already. Maybe it's time he risked being despised. Or even loved.

34	Phillip Meyer	American Rust	3/1/2009	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/everything-ravaged-0309	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	I thought the universal order of smart folks had agreed we were now living in a post-American world. If that's the case, then what's up with all the new novels that use American in the title  at least seven in 2008 alone. Maybe part of the answer is that we're a nation that has largely abandoned reading without entirely giving up on the mythic idea of the Great American Novel. I'm talking about old-school, realist fiction that seeks to show us who we are and how we might have gotten into this mess; books that are American in more than name alone. The way we live now, dig?  Here's what we have instead, the latest "American" novel, American Rust (Spiegel & Grau, $25). Its author, Philipp Meyer, writes heavy sentences full of monosyllables and simple truths. ("It is a good life to walk into someplace and eat food.") He knows how to break a story into three reasonably compelling acts. And even if the pitch is somewhat familiar  a pair of friends from a mining town commit a crime that threatens to change everything  the story is paced well. But for all the weight of its title, what American Rust actually delivers isn't so much Tom Joad as Joe the Plumber. This isn't the America we actually live in; it's a caricature populated by movie actors and a cardboard set of boarded factories. The writing, I think, is supposed to mimic the speech patterns of white working-class people. Instead, it sounds like an Ivy Leaguer mimicking the speech patterns of white working-class people. It's one part Woody Guthrie, one part All the Pretty Horses, and 98 parts Hillary Clinton.  We need something better and more honest than that. We need books that offer us a picture of the America we actually live in, rather than the one the Palins are selling us. We need books like Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $24). The stories in this new fiction collection by Wells Tower are set mostly in the places we do not wish to vacation in, but where many of us live. These are grim suburbs. Rings of shopping centers. Towns delineated by restaurants. The stories open with hangovers, fuel themselves on lousy food, and often end in extended, involuntary vacations. The emphasis is on life as it is lived  not in the grandeur of the cineplex but in small houses, and in the small moments of boredom and despair that characterize so much of our lives.   This isn't The Grapes of Wrath, to be sure. Tower doesn't offer much hope. Nor does he offer an elegy. And yet what his portraits lack in grandeur, they compensate for in their accuracy. The America depicted here is jittery and exhausted. Nobody solves the crime. And nobody gets away with anything. The characters muddle on through. They get drunk and they get sad and they go broke and they perform weird acts of kindness, and sometimes they invade smaller countries for no good reason. I mean they live the way we Americans do.

Those stories tend to center on fishing or Florida. Or both. But if your grandfather was a soul-ful, badass moonshiner who cranked around Franklin County, Virginia, shotguns at the ready, wouldn't you demand to hear his story?Matt Bondurant, a novelist from Virginia, fulfills this family duty. In The Wettest County in the World (Scribner, $25), he sets the writer Sherwood Anderson, father of the American grotesque, on an investigative mission to reveal the Bondurant clan. Together, they uncover an artery of booze and corruption and family that runs through the county, the state, the nation. There is blood. There is whiskey. There is the scent of gunpowder and gasoline hanging above the space through which the Bondurants pass, unrepentant, robed in their own greed. It's a dark, flinty reimagination of what a memoir — and your grandfather's stories — can be. 
37	Hanif Kureishi	Something to Tell You	8/1/2008	S	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/hanif-kureishi-0808	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	
Whats always been best about British novelist Hanif Kureishis work is that hes less interested in making his characters good and more concerned with making them interesting.
The narrator of his latest, Something to Tell You (Scribner, $25), is Jamal, a hyperliterate, half-Pakistani London-based cat. Hes a psychoanalyst with an interesting sister, kinky tastes in the bedroom, and best friends who operate on the shady side of the street. Heres a guy who can talk, and talk well. Hes also a guy who knows where to score the best weed.
This is a book about well-educated middle-aged adults dealing with lust, desire, and regret. But it isnt the kind of hyperliterate book in which people just sit around talking. Kureishi, who made his bones writing movies like My Beautiful Laundrette, knows things need to happen. So its the kind of book in which people do seriously bad things -- murder, incest, copious sex -- and then sit around talking about it. The work owes as much of a debt to Pedro Almodóvar as it does to Oscar Wilde.
Yet melodrama aside, the best thing about Something to Tell You is that it reminds readers that there used to be a place for intelligent conversation. The anecdotes are brief and well sculpted. The jokes, subtle and sad. Kureishis conversational writing sounds just like somebody talking -- until you stop and realize that its so much smarter than any talk youve overheard lately. 

38	Chris Adrian	A Better Angel	7/1/2008	S	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/chris-adrian-0808	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	The children in Chris Adrians A Better Angel (FSG, $22) are surrounded by flickering angels, inhabited by legions of ghosts, overtaken by viruses, handicaps, compulsions. Sometimes they speak to the devil. Sometimes he speaks through them. While all this might sound like the synopsis of a bottom-rack DVD, Adrians children are never mere ciphers for pain. They are simply kids, believable and true, imbued with wonder, hungry for cereal and a little television.  

And while these nine stories --  one of which  first appeared in the December 2007 issue of Esquire -- are all chilling, they never leer, or twist at the ligature of cheap sympathy. The sufferings of children are probably a damned good augury for our problems as a culture. Adrian, himself a pediatrician and seminary student, is a lucid, brilliant fortune-teller. He unveils our demons, who, in the wake of their visitations upon these children, reveal something you can only call the face of God. 

39	Andrew Sean Greer	The Story of a Marriage	5/1/2008	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/story-of-a-marriage-review	Esquire	Daniel Torday	How human it is, Don DeLillo wrote in Underworld, to see something as something else. Well, novelist and short story writer Andrew Sean Greer is all too human. He sees everything as something else. Or more properly Pearlie Cook, the African-American narrator of The Story of a Marriage, does. To Pearlie, a mans mind is like a map unfolded on a table, like a heliograph. And thats just in one paragraph.

When we meet Pearlie, its 1953 in San Francisco, and WWII is a lingering memory in her mind. But when a purported war buddy of her husband, Holland, shows up at her doorstep, were sure something nefarious is at hand. It turns out that Buzz, the guy on the doorstep, had been Hollands gay lover during the war, a war each of these men deserted. In a kind of mid-century Indecent Proposal, he offers to fulfill all of Pearlies financial dreams if shell let Holland leave with him forever. 

Its a fascinating premise. And it would be a promising set-up for Greers second novel, except that the plot is drowned in similes -- characters shattered like glass, memories compared to strings of pearls. Page after page, paragraph after paragraph. Its a pity, because when Greer actually writes plot and action, he shows flashes of the work he displayed in The Confessions of Max Tivoli, like this passage, where we learn about Buzzs experience in a 1940s wartime experiment: Apparently you cannot feed a starving man and expect gratitude, Pearlie tells us. A man, nearly dead, will snarl at his plate of food. In that way, we are untamable. Beautiful. 

Unfortunately, theres rarely prose as clear and sparkling as the former, and were left wondering how a novel that relies on seeing everything as something else comes to tell us about something outside itself, something that we, living through yet another war, can grasp onto. Mainly were struck that by the culmination of The Story of a Marriage, weve not learned much at all about one of its three main characters -- Holland, the object of desire for all its other characters. 

Theres some nagging sense that Greer does have something else in mind, something more contemporary and universal, as we move to the conclusion of this book. But were not ever quite certain what it is, and ultimately were plagued with the thought that if we just has come to know Holland -- rather than everything he is like and could be compared to -- maybe we would have found out.

The terrorists were anything but cowards. That's what Bill Maher said on air a week after 9/11. And then he was patriotically canned by ABC. 
In his new novel, which is muscular and disquieting and turn-the-pages-so-fast-you-tear-them good, Andre Dubus III raises the stakes on Maher's political incorrectness. His book doesn't ask you to see the terrorists as brave or cowardly; it forces you to see them simply as men, as human. Ballsy move.
The swift, fragmented narrative mostly unfolds at a Florida strip club, and the evening is spent with a terrorist who drives a leased Neon, a stripper who brings her toddler to work, a patron who gets bounced for innocently touching a dancer, and a landlord who, had she not taken ill, might have saved everyone.  
When the critics weigh in, there will be plenty of chatter about how Dubus so deeply inhabits even the most disturbing characters. And rightly so. But the book's most profound achievement is a far more difficult one: the omnipresence of hope in a hopeless place. The Garden of Last Days (Norton, $25) is riveting and disturbing, as beautiful as it is bleak, and if there are cowards among the cast of broken characters, I couldn't find them.   --Bret Anthony Johnston

2. Peace, by Richard Bausch
A story cleanly told -- void of trickery or plot shifting, without the faux drama of point-of-view shifts or uninvited monologue on the state of the cultural landscape -- well, that's a thing to behold.    

Peace (Knopf, $20), by Richard Bausch, is precisely that, a ruddy little nickel of a book -- the story of men sent up a hill on a routine reconnaissance mission at the end of World War II -- told in declarative, elementally mastered prose. At 178 pages, it spends quickly and travels the way a coin does -- surely and humbly confident in its own measure of gravity. 
There is no attempt to call attention to the way it is told, beginning with the simple footsteps into the guts of a cold rain. With each step up the mountain, the seven American soldiers drift further into the abyss of an occupied nation, further from what they most desire, which is to say an end, a return, peace.
Bausch, among the most prolific and accomplished story writers of the last two decades, provides a gift to those who like to swallow their stories whole, in one sitting, without digression or narrative handstands.

3. The Lazarus Project, by Aleksandar Hemon
The problem with too many writers is they give us what they think we'll like instead of giving us the best they've got. This isn't a problem with Aleksandar Hemon. His latest, The Lazarus Project (Riverhead, $25), hangs upon two linked narratives -- the death of Lazarus Averbuch, a turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrant to Chicago who is killed in a wash of bullets, and a contemporary Bosnian immigrant to Chicago who sets out to write Averbuch's tragic story. Together, the two narratives paint a portrait of a world that is as funny as it is terrible, characterized by violence and commerce, populated almost entirely by haves and have-nots, the quick and the dead. And the dead is the subject here. You can push and bully and probe history, but dead is dead. Nobody can bring back life. Not even one of our most talented writers.
This isn't a book you'll want to bring to the beach, unless you're in the habit of packing, say, Conrad next to your sunscreen. But it is a book that will challenge you to look closely at the world we inhabit. It will make you ask questions. Questions about death and life and remembrance. The kind of questions Hemon is known for. The kind we need more of.

45	Tobias Wolff	The Liar King	4/1/2008	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/our-story-begins-book-review	Esquire	Daniel Torday	Tobias Wolff is our great chronicler of liars. His seminal memoir, This Boys Life, began with an epigraph from Oscar Wilde: The first duty in life is to assume a pose. What the second is, no one has yet discovered. In the memoir, we watch as young Toby lies his way into one of the most prestigious prep schools in the country with a false identity hes crafted. Now as we endure a cultural moment where self-aggrandizing faked identity plagues the memoir, its instructive to note the kind of candor we find in Our Story Begins: New and Selected Stories, a book of short stories that unveils in story after story the personal truth of lying, rather than indulging in it. 
First theres the story simply called The Liar, wherein a sixteen-year-old lies compulsively, claiming his mother is suffering from some mortal illness. But there are more subtle kinds of deceit, and in the twenty-one stories selected from Wolffs earlier collections and ten new stories we come to see every way men, women and children lie to themselves -- and each other. In Levianthan theres coked-up Helen telling her coked-up friends about the time she feigned calm while gripped by a mortal fear of a menacing whale on an expedition with her retarded neighbor, lying to save the invalid from himself. In Morals theres Givens, who has gotten a cub reporter fired for calling in his own death so he can see his obituary published: Hed tried on his last suit, so to speak, seen himself roughed up and laid out, and listened to his own eulogy. And then theres the unnamed narrator of Firelight, who allows himself, just for an afternoon, to believe hes living in a beautiful old house with a fireplace, rather than the decrepit furnished apartments his mothers penury has subjected him to. We could never afford to live there, he says, but I was already losing my grip on that fact. 
And in the previously unpublished stories we find liars whose prevarications illuminate some of the most pervasive cultural issues of the moment. In White Bible we meet a recent immigrant who kidnaps his son Hassans teacher, trying to coerce her into letting Hassan off the hook for cheating, denying the reality that his son will never get into medical school. In The Deposition a lawyer pretends he wasnt stalking a teenage girl, never even aware why he was after her. And in the finest of them, Awaiting Orders, we meet Sergeant Morse, whose military service has forced him to conceal his homosexuality even as he sleeps with fellow soldiers, all while unconsciously wishing for a different identity altogether. Out to dinner with the abandoned son of one of his soldiers who has after shipping out to Iraq, Morse briefly convinces himself he could be perceived as the boys father. We see here most clearly the reasons we lie to ourselves: to fulfill our desires, to imagine ourselves into new lives. He had often wished that his desires served him better, Wolff tells us of Morse, but in this he supposed he wasnt unusual -- that it was a lucky man indeed whose desires served him well. A lucky man, indeed. Wolff reminds us again and again why we still return to fiction for what we need to know about how people live their lives. 

46	Richard Price	Lush Life	2/1/2008	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/lush-life-0308	Esquire	John H. Richardson	Richard Price knows. He knows how crime sounds and smells, and he knows that its all tied up in race and class, two big subjects all too rare in American fiction. He knows that the buildup and the aftermath are much more important than the bang-bang, and he knows that the human heart is really the thing that should be stored in a holster. In Clockers he made agonizing drama out of an insight that still eludes most of Americas political and judiciary class: Corrupt people bend; good people snap. 


Lush Life (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $26) is Prices version of a comedy. Three wannabe artists are out on a bender in New Yorks trendy Lower East Side when a couple of kids from the projects try to rob them. Wannabe A gets shot, but Wannabe B is too drunk to remember and Wannabe C is so bitter about his failure as an artist, the cops assume he did the shooting. They take him to the station and interrogate him so harshly that when they finally figure out hes innocent, hes too pissed off to help them find the real killer. The novel plays out from there, stocked with trendy poseurs and confused thugs. 
Price has been around for what seems like forever, but theres a reason we still read him. Because every sentence is a pleasure. Because he never puts a foot wrong, and never lingers. He takes just enough time to make you care. 

47	Stephen King	Duma Key	2/1/2008	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/duma-key-book-review	Esquire	Benjamin Percy	After gobbling up his more than forty novels and two hundred short stories, youd think the world might have had its fill of Stephen King. I admit to being a constant reader.  And despite all the years Ive spent in his skull, privy to his nightmares, King somehow remains compulsively readable. Can I say the same about the equally prodigious John Updike or Joyce Carol Oates? Im afraid I cant. As brilliant as they may be, I feel about them as I do a bus. You miss one of their books, no problem. Wait half an hour and another one will come grumbling along with the same sort of passengers having the same sort of conversations.  
Like all great horror writers, King is at his best when the speculative takes a backseat to character. Stories such as The Stand, The Shining, The Green Mile, and Different Seasons are profoundly moving not because they scare a gasp out of you (and they do), but because they so convincingly create people out of ink and paper who continue to live with you long after the book closes, years later coming up in soft-focus memory like friends youve lost touch with but vividly remember.
So it is with Duma Key (609 pages, Scribner, $28), Kings latest novel. In it we follow Edgar Freemantle, our narrator, who used to be a big deal in the building and contracting business until a twelve-story crane slams into his Dodge pickup and crushes it like a can on a Minnesota job site. His skull is fractured in three places. His ribs are broken. His right hip is shattered. And he loses his right arm. In this way the book and his other life begins. During the painful rehabilitation process, when a thousand midnight bells ring in his head and pain burns and stiffens his right side like a poker, when his wife leaves him and he begins to seriously contemplate killing himself, his therapist asks him if anything makes him happy. I used to sketch, Edgar says. So the therapist advises him to take up a pencil and pad again because Edgar needs hedges against the night.
He also needs a change of scenery, since everything in Minnesota reminds him of the life no longer available to him. So he relocates to Florida, where he lives in a rental on Duma Key, a mostly uninhabited nine-mile stretch of dune-rumpled beach and tangled jungle that has (of course) a poisoned history that eventually seeps its way into the narrative. But first, Edgar has to heal. He spends his days walking along the beach and painting to the soundtrack of the shell-riddled waves, their mild and steady sighing like the gossip of dead things telling secrets in bone voices. Soon he realizes that although he has lost an arm, he gained something else: an eerily serious talent with a paintbrush and easel.  As he paints little girls, a strange figure draped in red, a ghost ship with tattered sails, an almost unbearable itch takes over the space once filled by his missing arm, as though it were a divining rod. His injured and rewired brain has given him access to things that have been quiet for a long time. Things are coming back to life on Duma Key. 
Yes, the supernatural plays a key role in the plot, but to any reader who may shy away from the book for this reason, know that it doesnt overwhelm the narrative. King has written a story about a deeply troubled man who goes from wanting to die to wanting more than anything to live. The horror in the background serves as a sleek, black vehicle for helping him realize this transformation.
If Liseys Story and Duma Key are any indication, King is writing at a level equivalent to, if not better than, his last run of excellent work published in the nineties. And Im course eager to see what will come howling around the corner next. For now, Duma Key will continue to make my eyes go wide, the steadily rising terror of its chapters like the tide to a man buried neck deep in sand.    


48	Steve Toltz	A Fraction of the Whole	2/1/2008	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/fraction-of-whole-0208	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	
Heres my problem: Pretty much every time I get to the last 50 pages of a long novel, I wonder, What the hell did I read this for? All that time. All the lost hours. You can almost feel veins pulsing in the writer's temples. Yet for some reason, I take a look at the first page anyhow, because somewhere inside I am convinced that long books must still matter. Maybe this one will be worth it, I hope -- then I go in, falling to my knees, belly down under the pages. 

Well, A Fraction of the Whole (Spiegel & Grau, $25), by Australian Steve Toltz, is that rarest of long books -- utterly worth it -- which is why you'll have to bear with me on portents of this next line: This book is witty and intellectual, a physical comedy and literary rant all at once. The year is two months old. But this is the book of a two-month-old year. It may well carry the whole thing.
The story starts in a prison riot and ends on a plane, and there is not one forgettable episode in between, as a son tells the pop-pop-pop story of his criminally, lovingly insane father and their bizarre adventures flopping forward toward death, toward prison, toward Paris, and back; it reads like Mark Twain with access to an intercontinental Airbus. It's an episodic story, kite-strung with mind fucks. This book moves; it bucks and rocks in a world that feels more than a hemisphere away, a world where the crispy black shadow of 9/11 does not inform every word from the mouths of geniuses and the evolution of one man, let alone a planet. All 544 pages are so comically dark and inviting that you have no choice but to step forward into its icy wake.

49	Tom Perrotta	The Abstinence Teacher	10/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/tomperrotta1007	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	The movies have been very, very good to Tom Perrotta. His novel Election went unpublished until Alexander Payne adapted it into a film. The adaptation of Little Children garnered Perrotta an Oscar nomination. And his latest satire, The Abstinence Teacher (St. Martin's Press, $25), is set for a 2008 release. What a movie it will be: Divorced suburban mother of two fights the Tabernacle crazies who have taken over her school. 

The problem is that while Perrotta's novels may make for good movies, they don't make for very good books. The Abstinence Teacher is not very good for many of the same reasons that Little Children disappointed. The characters are a collection of easy sociological cues: Rich people live in McMansions, evangelical Christians dress badly. This is a world where women indicate sexual interest by donning sweaters with plunging necklines. And yet Perrotta remains that rarest of creatures, a genuinely successful literary novelist. His books sell, and critics often hold him as an heir to Cheever and Updike -- a comparison that is unfair to all involved.

I'd argue instead that Tom Perrotta is engaged in a more complicated and paradoxical project, one well suited to a postliterary age. He's writing books for people who don't much like books -- satires for nice people, fuck books for prudes. The problem with this approach is that it's not really satire at all. It's situational comedy. Perrotta's not gunning for laughs so much as light chuckles, perfect for a compassionate and confident grin. But less good for readers who'd be better served checking out David Gates or Stephen Dixon or simply giving up on books altogether and going to the movies.

50	Denis Johnson	Tree of Smoke	8/1/2007	L	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/denisjohnson0907	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	When it comes to the past, give it to me distant and pale. Herodotus, for instance. You can't really argue with the guy. City-states, swinging militarily from one end of the Aegean to the other, shapes of cultural movements described dryly and without dense moral hand-wringing. I like that stuff. By contrast, I've had enough of the near past, which I find confining, clouded by layer upon layer of artistic reckoning, and chronically overtold. The significance of recent decades ticks itself down like oily rosary beads on a short chain of self-importance. We get so much of what we can already remember. Still, in times of war, the cultural muscle is to revisit the past. But what the fuck are we looking for there? Morals? Lessons? One last glimpse of the jungle? Decades pass, books amble out of the brush, and we visit again and again with our devils. The question is: When to cease?   

I'd say now. Right after we've all finished Tree of Smoke (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $27), by Denis Johnson, the last book I will ever read on the '60s. In part, that's because it's a big book, a story that works in the best ways a big book can -- a multipronged tale, told in a straight-ahead chapter-by-chapter chronology, clear and light-bearing as a great tale, something like Lonesome Dove for the Tet Offensive set.
To say that readers have been waiting for a large crossover book like this from Denis Johnson for 20 years now would only echo the beef that some people have with his darkly lyric Jesus' Son or the shattering Angels, his best and first novel -- that Johnson's work is somehow too bleak and narrow for a broader readership. And so Tree of Smoke is being heralded, at long last, as the remedy for just that condition.
The shank of the book follows Skip Sands, an operative in psychological operations against the Viet Cong, a weirdly exterior character who drifts from one mission to the next, haunted by the shadow of his uncle Francis Sands, a CIA legend whom they call simply the Colonel. Moving in and out of the years are two hard-luck brothers, Bill and James Houston, who knock around Pacific postings before drifting homeward, toward the presumably insoluble pull of the vacant and scary desert of Arizona. One pair makes you larger, and one pair makes you small.
You know this sort of book. The requisite multiple characters -- mishmashed across several continents -- living lives that at times feel disconnected while remaining steadfastly knotted in their fates and the misjudgments of their culture. It's a big, chunky shag carpet of a novel, stretching wall-to-wall between 1963 and 1970. There's nothing particularly tricky in the structure, nothing wildly experimental in the tone or language. The sweep is purposefully grand, and Johnson knows how to work a large global stage, bouncing from one subtropical locale to another, without noisome conjuring. 
But the truth is, I won't read another book about the '60s because Tree of Smoke is old material, told in a fashion that is weirdly laconic and profoundly gung ho at the same time. Sometimes the dialogue throbs like a Sgt. Rock comic book, and then, pages later, a mere fistfight is described in a slippery, psychedelic light that is Johnson's own. I never know where to grab on, whom to care about. Maybe that's what the decade was like, too. I don't know. So many books. So many movies. I can't tell the difference between what I remember and what I've been told. Worse, I can't care anymore. And Tree of Smoke just doesn't make me.
The trouble is that, critics and publishing execs aside, no one was ever waiting for a knee-buckling crossover from Denis Johnson. He'd already dazzled and made us hurt. Done and done again. He'd already arrived.

51	Junot Díaz	The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao	8/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/junotdiaz0907	Esquire	Allison Glock	Junot Díaz isn't messing around. 
Yunior -- the narrator of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (Riverhead, $25) -- he is messing around. With women, with drugs, with his future, something both uncertain and fated. 
Through Yunior we learn of Oscar Wao's exquisitely damned immigrant family. We also learn of the so-called fukú curse they can't escape. It's a curse of your people, of love, of New Jersey. The curse that brought down longtime Dominican dictator Trujillo and JFK alike. And the curse that brings down Oscar -- a nerdy fatboy, disparaged and done for by age seven, the one Dominican teenager in all New Jersey who can't lose his virginity.
Like his shattering 1996 debut collection, Drown, Díaz's first novel is dense and thick, teeming with observations stacked tight like staples. From Santo Domingo to Paterson, New Jersey, from cane fields to college, Díaz mashes up history and modernity as we follow the doomed fate of Oscar's family. Magical realism and animal guides find a home alongside sex, salsa, and sadism. Díaz examines the ruinous damage wrought by Trujillo with the same fervor as he dissects Oscar's obsession with Tolkien and Akira. There are no real borders, just people and their stories and the inescapability of both. 

For Díaz, this is not simply a fashion but a philosophy. His writing is unruly, manic, seductive. He urges the reader to grab it all, exclude nothing, face facts, get laid, get drunk, smile on your brother, marry, and live your life in all its inescapable lunacy. Most important, don't fool yourself into believing that it could have unfolded any differently. Because like Oscar, no one escapes the past. Every character -- every person -- is damned from the start. 
And that, above all else -- more than the intricate language, the ambitious story arc, the weaving of timelines and plot -- is Díaz's peak accomplishment. Unfailing empathy. He judges no one. Not the whores or the fascists or the abusers. In Díaz's landscape, we are all the same, victims of a history and a present that don't just bleed together but stew. Often in hilarity. Mostly in heartbreak.
In the end, we are all fukú'd.

The men converge on an isolated Idaho bluff, high in the Rocky Mountains, ostensibly to collaborate on a summerlong construction project. They proceed inadvertently to rebuild themselves.
These are, of course, men who say what they mean and little else. Carlson telegraphs volumes via small gestures, and clipped phrases, as when one friend asks the other, "You ever fold clothes with a woman?" The answer: "No, I have not. I came close a time or two, I think."
Much of the story is devoted to describing the crew's daily chores: the machinations of post-hole digging, of asphalt paving, of iron welding, of sandwich making. No detail is too small; every minutia serves stunning purpose, reminding us of nothing less than what ultimately matters in this life: the quiet salvation of work. The value of mastering a tangible skill. The power of holding something in your hands, something you can control. 
"And so their days ended with this regard for their tools and the days began, as they squinted over coffee, in the exhilarating open air knowing where the shovel was, the chain, the awl."
Carlson's focus is transporting, absorbing. It shakes you from stupor, strips you down. He understands that most of us live in a world of enervating crap, whether in the cliffs of Idaho or the canyons of the city. And Five Skies offers a longed-for blueprint of the antidote. The three men are all saved, in their own way, by utility and geography. Their egos are dwarfed by the landscape, their hearts unburdened by the simple thrill of a task completed. We agree when Carlson describes civilization as "a hundred layers of ten thousand decisions, only a few of them even interesting." The men leave Five Skies the better for it. So do we.

56	Don DeLillo	Falling Man	5/1/2007	L	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/delillo	Esquire	Tom Junod	A few days after the planes hit and the buildings went down, The New York Times began offering its capsule profiles of the dead, its Portraits of Grief. They werent anything special, except insofar as the subjects were special -- except insofar as the profiles claimed that their subjects were special, and therefore worthy of notice, worthy of grief. It was journalism as public ritual, and the public partook of it as such, as Don DeLillo reminds us in his new novel, Falling Man: She read newspaper profiles of the dead, every one that was printed. Not to read them, every one, was an offense, a violation of responsibility and trust. But she also read them because she had to, out of some need that she did not try to interpret.The passage, in its documentary accuracy, and then its push towards some mystery of feeling beyond what can be documented, is characteristic of Falling Man, and characteristic of the method DeLillo has been working out since he first started publishing novels nearly forty years ago. DeLillos characters often do things for no other reason than they have to -- for no other reason that when a ritual presents itself, they attach themselves to it. In DeLillos world, human rituals are the primary means by which humans try to connect, and also the primary reason they dont. The character in question, a woman named Lianne, is not alone, in her determination to read the portraits of the dead; circa 2001, there were a lot of New Yorkers, and lot of Americans in general, determined to do the very same thing. But then, of course, shes very alone, and not simply because shes participating in a public ritual out of an unfathomable private impulse. Shes very alone because shes in a novel by Don DeLillo.Indeed, Falling Man, as both a post-9/11 novel and a novel by Don DeLillo, offers the best test-case yet for the idea that when the planes hit and the buildings went down we entered the age of nonfiction, when journalism, even journalism as modest in means as one of those Portraits of Grief, is able to grasp whats happened -- and, more to the point, whats happening -- to us more than fiction can, even fiction by our most accomplished and ambitious writers. Look at the scorecard: despite the post-9/11 concern that it might take a very long time for the events of that day to find fictional expression, American novelists have in very short order turned the post-9/11 novel into a veritable new genre, like chick-lit, but with the shoes left behind in the ash instead of beckoning brightly in the store window. Jay McInerney, Jonathan Safran Foer, Claire Messud, Ken Kalfus and the underesteemed Jess Walter have all turned out their post-9/11 novels, and yet for all their ambition and accomplishment none of these books have managed to say what those Portraits did, which was that the victims of 9/11 might have died alone, but they certainly didnt live alone; which was that they, and the people who survived them, knew exactly was at stake on that day, and what was lost; which was that the vast majority did not have to wonder if they loved their families and if their families loved them; which was that they really were innocent victims, and that until the planes came, they were, despite their goofy rituals -- hell, because of their goofy rituals -- reasonably happy.Now, with Falling Man, Don DeLillo takes his crack at the post-9/11 novel, and God knows, theres no one in our literature who has done more to earn the right. After all, the man has been writing the post-9/11 novel for the better part of four decades, and his pre-9/11 novel, the magnum-opusy Underworld, was prescient enough to put the looming towers on its cover, standing high and ready to fall, or, as he says in the new book, fantasies of wealth and power that would one day become fantasies of destruction. There has always been the aura of prescience, even prophesy, surrounding DeLillo, and its part of the paradox of his career: on the one hand, he has that mandarin rep, and is often used as an exhibit in the argument that American writers now practice literature only for literatures -- or their own -- sake; on the other hand, he has practiced exactly what the arch-populist Tom Wolfe has preached, and has gone out and gotten the story. And so while Wolfe, in his novels, may be said to have anticipated, say, the Duke lacrosse scandal, DeLillo may be said to have anticipated, oh, just about everything else. The future belongs to crowds, he wrote in Mao II, in what has become his most famous pronouncement, and hes back at it again in Falling Man, though this time hes looking back, the rueful prophet who has lived to see his pronouncements turn into epitaphs. The crowd was gifted at being a crowd, he writes of an anti-war demonstration in 2003. This was their truth. He has been insisting for as long as hes been writing that humanity has turned into a mass-organism, twitching with the plots and conspiracies hatched by loners desperate for connection, and so 9/11 itself stands, perversely, as the high point of his career or at the very least the fulfillment of all his foreboding. It was a day he himself might have authored, DeLilloesque not only as the end-point of a conspiracy but as a mass-event witnessed by billions, and who could see the Falling Men and the Falling Women -- the people who jumped, and were swallowed by the horrific discrepancies of scale -- without conceding that DeLillo had gotten it right?And so, of course, there is much that DeLillo gets right in Falling Man. He has the seeming advantage of working in hindsight here, and also the advantage of his uniquely poised and meticulous talent. He is unequalled as a phrasemaker, and so the writer who gave us, in White Noise, the airborne toxic event, here gives us organic shrapnel, which he defines as human flesh that got driven under the skin when the falling buildings unleashed their own toxic clouds. He gives us, as a portrait of the North Towers lingering façade, the strands of bent filigree that were the last standing things. He gives us the eventual protein stupor of the Alzheimered, and he gives us premature baldness as a gentle melancholy, the pensive regret of a failed boy. He gives us his signature oracular cadences -- for his books are all rhythm, all cadence -- and the sentences that announce their significance by seeming tweezered out of the void. He gives us everything weve come to expect in a DeLillo novel, and then something that we could never imagine in a DeLillo novel: the kick of nostalgia. Falling Man turns out to be a historical novel of five years ago, and it brings with it the shock of recognition: for those days when people felt that the most important thing in the world was to say exactly what they were doing when the buildings fell; for those days when reading newspaper profiles of the dead felt like a solemn obligation; for those brief, numbered days when, as one character tells himself, everything seemed to mean something.And yet, because Falling Man is a Don DeLillo novel as much as it is a post-9/11 novel, it turns out that nothing does. This is not a giveaway, but rather an inevitability signaled in advance by every sentence of the book. The plot itself couldnt be simpler: Keith, a man estranged from his wife and child, returns to his wife and child after escaping from the towers, covered in ash and embedded with organic shrapnel. They reconcile, sort of, though Keith defines reconciliation thusly: Were ready to sink into our little lives. And oh, their lives are little indeed. They cant speak to one another, for when they do they sound like space aliens who have learned English by watching Lindsay Crouse pronounce her lines in David Mamet movies. Keith, for his part, refers to his son as he would an underage stranger -- he refers to him exclusively, and not affectionately, as the kid -- and Lianne, though nominally more human than Keith, watches her poor son playing ball with dear old Dad, and thinks that the boy was like a pitching machine with hair and teeth, register set to peak velocity. The fact of human isolation is DeLillos own fundamentalism, and Falling Man is simply the machine for returning his characters safely back to it, even as the novel simultaneously delivers one of 9/11 conspirators into a connection with God and his jihadist brethren that is terrible because it is so total. Does DeLillo get this right, too? The question is worth asking, and not only because if we grant him his authority in public matters, we have to admit that his private vision has always been more troubling -- we have to admit that outside of a Don DeLillo novel, we might search the world over and never find a mother who thinks of her son as a pitching machine with hair and teeth. No, the question is worth asking precisely because Falling Man hews so closely to whats already happened, to what we already know, that it exists in the shade of reality, and reality overwhelms it. And not the public reality of the towers falling down, either -- it does just fine with that, with its unbearably precise rendering of an atmosphere turning to ash. The reality that overwhelms the novel is the private reality of all those lives lost when the towers fell, for its a reality that DeLillo cant bring himself to face. In general, Falling Man sticks to what we think of as the facts; in general, it seeks to recreate that lifelong week, three days after the planes rather than to reimagine it, and so its one significant invention becomes instructive. There is a falling man, in Falling Man, but he is not the falling man of Richard Drews famous photograph, not the falling man captured almost in repose against the perfect symmetry of towers north and south, not the falling man whose very public private death has come to stand for the simultaneous affirmation and erasure of the American soul. The falling man in Falling Man is a performance artist who shows up in various locations in New York City, suspending himself in the air in the pose of Drews falling man -- arms at his sides, one leg bent at the knee -- and becoming, as DeLillo has it, another instrument of Liannes final isolation. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I admit a prejudice here. I wrote the article for Esquire that gave Richard Drews photograph its name, and I might be carping at DeLillo in order to express anger at his appropriation. But I dont think so. I have a pretty good idea who the Falling Man was, and he was neither a performance artist nor a totem of severed human connections. He was a man, and his tragedy was not that he made it possible for people not to love their families; his tragedy was that he loved his family, and was loved in return, and that his connection to them continues in the afterlife of Drews indelible image, and is unbearable. And so what I asked of DeLillos Falling Man was not that it be inventive, but that it be commensurate -- commensurate to all the falling men, and the falling women, and their agony; commensurate, at the very least, to the capsule profiles that people forced themselves to read day after day, five years ago. And its not. Its a portrait of grief, to be sure, but it puts grief in the air, as a cultural atmospheric, without giving us anything to mourn. It captures our subsequent fall from grace -- and who ever knew that we might look back on September 11, 2001, as perhaps our last, best opportunity for grace? -- without ever suggesting a reason for it other than the fact that grace is awfully hard to come by DeLillos world. It is the irony here: the Don DeLillo novel became the template for 9/11; now 9/11 returns the favor, and becomes the template for a Don DeLillo novel. He gets it right because he already got it right, and yet when one of the characters in Falling Man says, Ask yourself: what comes after America?, the book winds up answering its own terminal question. What comes after America is another Don DeLillo novel, another beautiful artifact made exquisitely out of ash. 
57	Michael Chabon	The Yiddish Policemen's Union	5/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/jew0507	Esquire	Adam Kirsch	Michael Chabon has a problem with growing up. Not that his talent isn't full-fledged. But whether he's writing about middle-aged stoners (Wonder Boys) or genius comic-book artists (The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), he's always wondering what it means to be an adult, a real writer. Does it mean he has to give up believing in superheroes?   In The Yiddish Policemen's Union (HarperCollins, $27), he once again sets out to tackle the hardest questions -- about American promise, the nature of belonging, and the possibility of redemption -- by harnessing the energy of a somewhat disregarded, some might say adolescent, genre. In this case, pulp detective novels. His leading man, Meyer Landsman, is a direct descendant of Philip Marlowe, a beaten-down, beaten-up antihero who gropes for the truth in a fog of alcohol and lies. If you've ever seen film noir, you know what's in store for Landsman: He gets lied to, threatened, held prisoner, blackjacked, and shot.       Yet if Chabon is channeling Raymond Chandler, he's also doing something much more difficult and rewarding, because the mean streets Landsman patrols aren't in L.A.; they're in Sitka, Alaska, a decaying metropolis inhabited by millions of Yiddish-speaking Jews. We gradually discover that just as Philip Roth tweaked the outcome of history in The Plot Against America, Chabon has played his own trick: He imagines that Sitka, not Israel, was declared the Jewish homeland after World War II.       Chabon clearly had a lot of fun inventing Sitka, a city brimming with characters as obsessively imagined as any in a teenager's fantasy world. It's this playfulness that keeps his Yiddish dream from sinking into mere sepia-toned nostalgia.    Yet the question lingers: Should Chabon be read with a straight face or an indulgent grin?
58	Nathan Englander	The Ministry of Special Cases	4/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/Argentina0507	Esquire	Tyler Cabot	He's an hijo de puta. The son of a whore. But not just any whore: a Jewish whore. And in case your Hebrew-school teacher didn't tell you what that means, let me explain. It means Kaddish Poznan is done. Cosmically eighty-sixed. The rabbi and community won't touch him, and he thinks God forgot him long ago.   But there's more. Because this is Buenos Aires in 1976 and the state-sponsored suppression of the Dirty War is about to begin. Men fall from buildings. Children fall from the sky. Order is kept via bureaucracy. And soon, despite the biggest, toughest, thickest door a mother can buy, Kaddish Poznan's son, Pato, will vanish. And with that, the frantic search that tears through Nathan Englander's first novel, The Ministry of Special Cases (Knopf, $25), begins.       Priests will be bribed, generals blackmailed, and rabbis beseeched. Faith tried, tested, and buried. All the while, Englander's prose moves along with a tempered ferocity -- simple yet deceptively incisive. In the end, once you've repeatedly imagined Pato's possible torture and death once and again, you'll realize that Englander's book isn't so much about the search for a lost boy. It's about fathers and sons and mothers and faith and community and war and hope and shame.    Yes, that's a lot to pack into 339 pages. But not when a book reads at times with the urgency of a thriller. Not when the main character is an hijo de puta.
59	Roberto Bolaño	The Savage Detectives	3/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0407-APR_MAHB_POETS	Esquire	Buddy Kite	Meet the Visceral Realists: a razor-tongued, pot-smoking, self-obsessed gang of horny Mexican poets. There's Ulises Lima, a vagabond who infects his gracious hosts with scabies. And Luscious Skin, a lothario who recounts a "butt-lashing" sexual encounter over four very detailed pages. They're the anti-heroes in The Savage Detectives (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $27), a bizarre and mesmerizing novel by the late Chilean-born author Roberto Bolano.
			Just now published in English, the book is a fist-to-gut introduction to a deceptively powerful writer who died at age 50 in 2003. It's a lustful story--lust for sex, lust for self, lust for the written word. On a self-destructive quest to figure out what the hell their own movement is even about, the gangster poets swing you from Mexico to Paris and back, eluding murderous pimps, plotting revolutions, and having lots and lots of sex along the way. 
			Their antics will repulse you. Your moral compass will be pissed upon. But in a world where a guy who cuts up his penis with a blade is considered a "real man," Bolaño's visceral real-ists shine. They offer a blunt yet poignant reminder: No, not all poets are tea-sipping aesthetes. In fact, say the wrong word about Bolano and you might get knifed. 	

60	Nicola Monaghan	The Killing Jar	3/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/killingjar031407	Esquire	John Burgman	The Killing Jar ($24.00, Scribner) reads like Hermione Granger's post-rave walk through the streets of A Clockwork Orange. A sweet English girl is asked by her addict mother to sell drugs on the playground, and so begins Kerrie-Ann's blazing descent into all things illegal. Eventually separated from her brother and placed into a boardinghouse for girls, Kerrie-Ann stays sane by clinging to the most stable thing in her life: Ecstasy. And as the drugs provide the highs, life provides plenty of lows: molestation and teacher-student rape, awkward sex and carjackings. At one point Kerrie-Ann watches a boy being burned alive via gasoline and a flicked match. Part revengeful romp, part recreational brutality, the scene is all the more strange because Kerrie-Ann seems unaffected by it. But you won't
be. 

Sure, at times The Killing Jar feels like it's trying to one-up itself as each chapter becomes increasingly grim and violent -- I'll see your broken nose and raise you a brutal stab wound. But that's not why you should read it. You should read it for Kerri-Anne's modern-Nottingham dialect, which for some reason makes her teen angst and drug-spiral far more compelling than that of the masses. You should read it because there's enough chemical punch to leave you pleasantly buzzed. You should read it because sometimes a shot to the face isn't such a bad thing.

61	Julian Barnes	The Lemon Table	3/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0704book_of_month	Esquire	Adrienne Miller	A FRENCH LITERARY SYPHILITIC.  This is just a brief entry into the multivalent mind of Julian Barnes. In 14 books of stunning range, the brilliant Englishman has become one of the very few writers you cannot afford not to read. His classic 1984 novel, Flaubert's Parrot, is as provocative and mischievous a literary sleight of hand as Nabokov's Nikolai Gogol. And last year we saw Barnes's delicate translation of In the Land of Pain, the journals of the 19th-century French novelist Alphonse Daudet, which Daudet wrote as he was dying from syphilis. You see what I mean about Barnes's famous range.  And now The Lemon Table (Knopf, $23). The past's influence over the present is a major theme in all of Barnes's work, and these stories are a strong case in point. They reveal how time changes people and how it changes love. A man still can't manage to say what he needs to say to the woman he loves in "The Story of Mats Israelson," even as he lies dying. In "Knowing French," a clever old woman begins a monumental correspondence with a novelist named Julian Barnes. And then this from an elderly composer who stands watching the sky for cranes in the closing story, "The Silence": "Today they did not come. There were only wild geese. Geese would be beautiful if cranes did not exist." These gracefully constructed stories are subtle, erudite, and wise; they elevate us because there are few such generous observers of humanity. In a word: The Lemon Table is Barnes at his profound, dexterous best.
62	Joe R. Lansdale	Lost Echoes	2/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/bookreview022707	Esquire	Snowden Wright	In recent years, the merits of crime noir have been praised, understandably and justifiably, by the likes of Michael Chabon, Patrick Anderson, and Barry Hannah.  It would seem that crime noir, a genre so long looked down at by high-minded writers, is due for a literary rebirth.  Unfortunately, Joe R. Lansdale's Lost Echoes -- boiled hard and written soft -- is not the book to do it.

Want a few examples why? Well check out the way people die: the neck of a Bible salesman is snapped by a stack of falling Bibles; a mother and her child are pulverized by a dump truck load of gravel; the body of a cross-dressing pink-panty-wearing cop is found hanging from a lamp cord. Ironic and amusing, perhaps. But not exactly the sort of plot moments that beg to be taken seriously. And the remainder of the plot is similarly ridiculous. Its protagonist, Harry Wilkes, is a college student who can "hear" visions of past crimes. With the help of an alcoholic martial arts sensei, he soon learns to embrace his extrasensory gifts to solve a gruesome murder. 

Not that Lost Echoes doesn't have some redemptive aspects. Its narrative voice, a mix of down-home slang and bar-side ramble, has its charm. And its scenes of psychic flashback violently shock expectations. Are these qualities enough to save it? Not quite. But they're something. And like an imperfect relationship, if you appreciate Lost Echoes for what it is rather than for what it fails to be, you may enjoy it.

63	Martin Amis	House of Meetings	2/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0107bigbook	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	If gulags don't sound like your idea of fun, be forewarned: Martin Amis's new novel, House of Meetings (Knopf, $23), is not a fun book. It's something of a labor, actually--forced labor, collective labor, the labor of love. And as Amis tells the story of two brothers locked in a slave camp, he labors mightily to make real the nightmare of Russian history. Often he succeeds. Sometimes the characters get stuck in the fog of tragedy, the prose turning didactic and portentous. (Stalin bad. Got it.) But even when Amis fails, he says things better and more beautifully than anybody else playing the game. He still owns the subject of male violence, and it's fascinating to see him turn his attention from the atrocities of the pub to the megahorrors of the pogrom. And every 20 pages or so, he writes a sentence that reminds you why you've got to read him. So read this book. And when you've finished, drink a bottle of vodka. Smoke cigarettes. Cry over the inescapable certainty of death and the impossible beauty of women. Drink more. Smoke more. Think about the ways you are glad that you are not Russian and only have to read about being Russian. In the Siberian cold of January, be glad for Martin Amis.

64	Philip Roth	Everyman	2/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0506BOOKS_41	Esquire	Scott Raab	THE ANONYMOUS PROTAGONIST of Philip Roth's new novel, Everyman (Houghton Mifflin, $24), is buried as the book opens. He dies three lines from its end. In between, he suffers a series of blows to his health, betrays three wives, estranges two sons, loses his parents, comes to hate a loving brother--his sole sibling--and discovers that "old age isn't a battle; old age is a massacre." So it's a fairly safe bet that Everyman won't enjoy the commercial success of 2004's The Plot Against America, unless the AARP founds a book club devoted to the literature of the arterial stent.That the central character in a book by Philip Roth winds up lost and alone, a good boy who has become a man devoured by devouring desire, ain't exactly news. Nor was it news in Genesis. The lacerations and decay of the flesh, however--Roth here devotes far more detail to hospital procedures and the art of grave digging than to sex--reveal more nakedly than ever a novelist who has always snapped the Yahwistic lash of the Old Testament's boss man. Fuck sin: The wages of life are death--but only after full rations of pain and loss. The upside, of course, is that Roth is the best fiction writer America has ever produced. And Everyman is fiction as calligraphy, a ribbon of memory spun from a single stroke across a couple hundred pages, encircling, and entombing, a life.
65	John Updike	Villages	1/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ1104-BIG-BOOK	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	What's interesting  about reading a John Updike book is that every word, every scene, every vaguely misogynistic simile used to describe the unending daisy chain of oddly singular suburban fuck buddies, every pastoral snatch of, well, pastoral snatch, when told through the angry orange sunset of Updike's unflagging prose, reminds you of only what you are doing at that very moment. One sex scene roiling into the next, you almost want to say aloud, "I am reading a John Updike novel!"  So it is with Villages (Knopf, $25), which follows the life arc of Owen Mackenzie across the familiar landscape of Updike's increasingly formless New England suburbanry. The  details of Mackenzie's work, the topography of a nation through which he moves, feel as if Updike's doing a flyby over the latter half of a century that one suspects has disappointed him.  As always, with no room to like Mackenzie or even much care about him, it's all about Updike and not at all about the characters who people his book. But of course, you don't read  Updike for the characters. You read him for the pleasure of his constant and peculiar ability to narrate one sexual congress on the heels of the last, each with the admirable muscularity of a chef wielding a knife. And in this rampant energy, Villages does not  disappoint, so that Mackenzie, his trusty cock growing and shrinking like some exotic zoo animal, fucks his way across the decades, a grumpy, pussy-soaked picaro. In everything he does, he asserts what he is, Updike's own creation, recognizable and true.

Cutty, One Rock, by August Kleinzahler (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $18). Nine autobiographically linked stories, all tinged with alcohol, literature, and contemplation, all reminiscent of a six-hour slog at the local bar with a close confidant. 2. Fraternity, by Bob Greene (Crown, $24). The award-winning journalist and celebrated author returns from a period of exile with an extraordinary book about the American presidency told in the voices of five former office holders. 
67	Arthur Phillips	The Egyptologist	1/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0904-BIG-BOOK	Esquire	Benjamin Alsup	FOR ALL ITS Gen X trappings, Arthur Phillips's first novel, Prague, was essentially an old-school novel of ideas, a retro gabfest populated by the well-educated, the hyperarticulate. Its characters drank brandy, mourned the passing of youth, and meditated upon the meaning of nostalgia. And the novel succeeded in invoking the pleasures of cafe society just as those pleasures seemed certain to fade under a wash of tabloid headlines. Prague served, at once, as pleasurable throwback and quiet elegy. 
With The Egyptologist (Random House, $25), Phillips offers another meandering book stocked with anachronistic charms, this one a slow and intricately built whodunit for the King Tut lover in all of us. Trading the spoken word for the written one, Phillips constructs his tale entirely from old-fashioned modes of communication--the long and expository letter, the urgent cablegram, the private journal. Two narrative lines spin out to form a rather tangled plot: A salty retired P.I. from Sydney recounts his most baffling case while an Egyptologist from Harvard details his all-or-nothing search for proof of a legendary king. When it works, this approach calls to mind the intertextual urgency of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the darkly comic play of Nabokov's Pale Fire. When it doesn't, it calls to mind a melodramatic pastiche of these influences--a postmodern experiment that seems like more fun for the writer than the reader.
I'd be surprised if you didn't have the central mystery of this caper figured out somewhere before the halfway point. But here's the thing: I'd also be surprised if this bothered you too much. After all, when is the last time somebody made the effort to spin you a tale? When is the last time somebody wrote you a  letter? When is the last time you encountered a contemporary writer with Phillips's  far-reaching interests and easy  facility with far-away places,  far-away times?

68	Phillip Roth	The Plot Against America	1/1/2007	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ1004-BIG-BOOK	Esquire	Scott Raab	In 1963, when Philip Roth had published one novel (not so good), a novella, and some short stories, he wrote "Writing About Jews," an essay defending his work against those Jewsnot mere Jews: rabbiswho had accused him of pandering to anti-Semitism and failing to heed the lessons of the Holocaust.  "For those Jews who choose to continue to call themselves Jews," wrote Roth, back when Hitler's death camps were no less fresh in memory than the Reagan presidency is today, "there are courses to follow to prevent it from ever being 1933 again that are more direct, reasonable, and dignified than beginning to act as though it already is 1933or as though it always is." (Emphasis Roth's.)Roth went on to accuse his accusers of "piously summoning up the 'six million' to justify" their own "timidityand paranoia."Nowabout 40 years and 20-odd books later, in the gloaming of a career that, for my two cents, has established Roth beyond argument as the greatest fiction writer America has ever producedcomes The Plot Against America (Houghton Mifflin, $26). It is 1940, Charles Lindberghin secret league with Hitler's Reichhas wrested the White House from FDR, and the U.S. has begun tightening a noose around the tender neck of American Jewry.This is a richly terrifying historical novel, surely the only work of Roth's that may be called a page-turner in the usual sense of the term. Timidity and paranoia asidebut always, for Jews anywhere, within reachits terror echoes in our world and our America. Read the news, listen to Fox News's vox populi, gaze deep into John Ashcroft's dead-fish eyes. We live one dirty bomb away from martial law, and not much farther from another refrain of "Round up the Jews."

70	Unknown	The Koran	10/1/2006	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ1006-ESQ100.P12-13.FINAL.REV_2	Esquire	Tom Junod	It's not easy, treating the Koran as literature-that is, as a book we are free to pick up or put down depending on our appreciation of its merits. First of all, its great literary achievement is said to be the musical perfection of its classical Arabic, and music is what's lost in translation. Second, it does not treat itself as literature but rather as divine utterance, and the presumed freedom of its readers is precisely what it argues against. Third, it is absent virtually all of the pleasures of literature. What survives most translations of sacred texts is narrative skill or at least a willingness to subject the sacred to the rigors of story. The Gospel of John may put forth a lot of crazy ideas, but it hooks the reader from "In the beginning was the word," mainly because such a sentence supposes there was a beginning, and therefore an end. The Koran makes no such concessions. Indeed, the Prophet Muhammad-or, if the book's conceit is to be believed, Allah, with the Prophet Muhammad as His amanuensis-is, by modern conventions, a singularly inept storyteller. To a mind-numbing degree, he is repetitive, discursive, and entranced by the authority of his own voice. He is also abusive and devotes about a third of his book, by weight, to bloodcurdling invective against the infidel in all his guises. He is, to be frank, a terrible bore, but because he is at such pains to put himself beyond the judgment of those who might say that he does go on a bit-mere readers-he puts himself in league with the most notoriously boring writers history has had to offer: the tyrants who have thought of themselves as poets.  And yet, despite the Koran's self-styled resistance to a purely literary reading, it is essential that we give it exactly that, for literature is what gives us the tools for understanding it. What strikes any reader of the Koran is first its familiarity and then its strangeness. Adam, Abraham, Noah, Joseph, Moses, Jesus, even Mary the Virgin Mother: They are all there, and yet they are not employed to advance anything like the "Judeo-Christian tradition." Rather, they are there to be subsumed, like all the rest of Creation, into a completely new and nonlinear telling. There is a reason Hollywood has never made The Koran, and it goes deeper than its fear of giving offense. The fact is, the Koran's Moses is less interesting than the Bible's Moses-not to mention Cecil B. DeMille's-and the same goes for all the characters it holds in common with the Old and New Testaments. The Koran is uninterested in the niceties of character and drama. It is ferociously nonrepresentational and extols other gods for the purpose of striking them down in favor of the One and the Only. In his theory of the "anxiety of influence," Harold Bloom posited that all poets live in thrall to their predecessors, until they succeed in slaying them on the page. Well, in the Koran, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him--no, really!) lives in thrall to the cosmology established by the Jews and the Christians, and he goes about liberating himself with a vengeance. The first chapter, or sura, is just a few verses long and offers a prayer both to Muhammad's one God and to his own unitary intentions. In the second sura, however, he goes after the Jews, arguing--starting on page 4, for crying out loud--that although they were indeed chosen by God, they did not return the favor, and so proved themselves unworthy of his protection and, of course, this, His Holy Koran. Indeed, the second sura's title--"The Cow"--refers to Jewish disobedience, to the object of a divinely ordered sacrifice nearly left unmade. Here is the Anxiety of Influence, enacted in a foundational way, by an obsessive intelligence whose military leanings were not limited to metaphor. Talk about literary feuds: The Hebrews got their jealous God, the Muslims got their jealous book, and the whole world shudders with the consequences. 

71	Cormac McCarthy	The Road	8/1/2006	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0906BOOKS_94_1	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	THE CINEMATIC AND LITERARY versions of the postapocalyptic world always include hardy bands of survivors who somehow manage to stumble upon remarkable stores of weapons, food, and useful cultural toys. Sure, vampires or zombies or marauding motorcyclists prowl the landscape, but their presence always seems a small price to pay, a sort of puzzle for the multiracial, gender-balanced survivors to deal with before they set up the groundwork for the new world. Enter Cormac McCarthy, the elemental prose stylist of our time, with his new novel, The Road (Knopf, $24), a book so intensely unlike his previous work that you might be left wondering if this really is the same author of those hard-bitten west-Texas narratives Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses. It draws, in crisp little passages about the length of your thumb, the end of the world as the story of a father and son wheeling a shopping cart along a road through the remains of a cold, ashy, picked-over nation that must have been ours once. Where are they? There's no way to know. The names of cities have been forgotten. What has happened? Choose your poison. There are memories of cholera outbreaks, evidence of firestorms. Small packs of cannibals tramp the road behind wagons drawn by slaves. Nothing grows. There are few places that have not been rummaged, scavenged, and stripped. At one point, the man--this father--squats in a barn and scrapes from the floor the dried seeds left by an ancient haystack, puts them in his mouth, and chews. It actually gives the reader some hope. It's an adventure, believe it or not--the sort of book that, if only for the relentless clarity of the writing, the lucid descriptions of the grasses, the mud, the thorns, and the very arc of the road that cuts through all that, presents a clear and episodic progress from one small terror to the next. Forget comfort and possession. Postapocalypse or not, it's classic McCarthy. No one seeks or finds. The father and son move because everyone moves. Theirs is a world of ghosts, vapors, gods. They evade rather than progress. And they are plenty scared the whole way. This father and son remain, at their very core, no less than that: a father and a son. Against the conspiracies of indifference that surround them, the father struggles for answers, for solutions, to keep them safe, to help the boy see the world that once was, while the boy, terrified to the brink of stupor, asks the questions of a child raised in a world that no one has ever known before. What is a train, after all, to a boy who has never seen one move? What is a pear? Why did they even make roads if there is nowhere to go? The answers come from the father. He knows them. He's lived in our world, after all. But you shouldn't read this book for the metaphoric possibilities of change in the life of mankind. You know all that crap already. Yeah, yeah, we're headed for doom. You should read this book because it is exactly what a book about our future ought to be: the knife wound of our inconvenient truths, laid bare in a world that will just plain scare the piss out of you on a windy night.

72	T.C. Boyle	Talk Talk	6/1/2006	S	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0706BOOKS_30	Esquire	Tom Chiarella	Two Books for the Road (or Raft)HOME TO VAST oil resources and President Putin's powerful conservative political base, Siberia wields a disproportionate amount of Russian power. Throw in enough Christian fundamentalists to make Jerry Falwell weep, and the remote Siberian wilderness begins to feel downright familiar. Kind of like Texas. All of which makes it the perfect backdrop for Jeffrey Tayler's latest trip through global politics on foot--or, as this case may be, raft--River of No Reprieve: Descending Siberia's Waterway of Exile, Death, and Destiny (Houghton Mifflin, $24). Tayler takes a 2,400-mile journey down the Lena River to the arctic circle, through villages, nightclubs, and former gulags, exposing the joys and horrors of modern Siberian life, in which drunken skinheads battle Jesus freaks, petty bureaucrats compete with ruthless mobsters, and everyone wants to screw the hardened but gorgeous frontier women. It's a portrait of a ruggedly beautiful and politically influential land, an alien place you'd probably never want to visit.  --BEN HUGHES HERE'S A BAD SIGN: The most compelling scene in Talk Talk (Viking, $26), T. C. Boyle's new chase novel, is the first, in which Dana Halter, a deaf schoolteacher, is stopped for a routine traffic violation only to be arrested, jailed, and generally brutalized for outstanding warrants run up by an identity thief. Halter is so defenseless that her life quickly liquefies--job lost, finances ruined. Sympathy is a heady tonic, and the truth is, you do feel, in those first 15 pages, that this could happen to anyone, especially you. You make a note: Visit Staples. Buy shredder.The idea of Dana Halter chasing Dana Halter has the makings of a postmodern house of mirrors--at least until the thief quickly sheds Halter's name, abandoning with it Boyle's typical authorial puzzle and any sense of palpable predicament. What ensues is a soggy, spiritless chase from West Coast to East, Boyle examining the social slights that make life for deaf people so difficult along the way. In the end, ironically, it's the thief's loss that we care about, not Halter's. That might be Boyle's point. But if so, it's also the fleshiest, most intriguing crime in the book.  --TOM CHIARELLA 

73	Gary Shteyngart	Absurdistan	6/1/2006	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0606ABSURDISTAN_2	Esquire	Unknown	"THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT LOVE," the Russian-American writer Gary Shteyngart promises in his new novel, Absurdistan (Random House, $25). A book about lies would be more like it. On its face, this follow-up to Shteyngart's well-received The Russian Debutante's Handbook tells the tale of Misha Vainberg, a grossly overweight, overwealthy son of a Russian gangster who gets stranded in the land of Absurdistan. But the book is really just an excuse for Shteyngart to do his "oh, me so young and clever" routine and offer his useless socioeconomic observations. Like, God help us, rap: "Heah come dat bitch / from round de way / box my putz / like Cassius Clay." Nice, huh? Too bad a little Googling exposes the real hardcore, old-school gems, like photos of the eager beaver mugging it up at the Stuyvesant High School Young Republicans clambake. As for the writing, yes, Shteyngart can sometimes pen a neat sentence. But what Russian can't? We're born with this stuff. Absurdistan's most odious creation is a certain fellow novelist whom Shteyngart describes as "an upper-middle-class phony who came to the United States as a kid and is now playing the professional immigrant game." Shteyngart later accuses this colleague of impregnating his students at Hunter College, including the protagonist's girlfriend, Rouenna Sales. Reader, I am him. And never have I been so publicly libeled. Those students were pregnant before I met them! An "upper-middle-class phony"? This coming from Shteyngart, a writer whose knowledge of the South Bronx (featured exhaustively in Absurdistan) is limited to once soaring over the 'hood on a JetBlue flight to Burlington, Vermont. As for the sultry Latina Rouenna Sales, believe me, I know Shteyngart's amorous habits well. Let's just say there's more kimchi on his plate than arroz con pollo.Do what you have to, Mr. Shteyngart; build your modest throne on the corpses of your countrymen. But, as my lawyer will soon tell you, we live in a world where words have consequences. And if I can't earn your respect, I'll take your money. We're both Americans now, pal.
74	Gabriel García Márquez	Memories of My Melancholy Whores	11/1/2005	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ1105_bigbookmemories_1	Esquire	Scott Raab	A year before winning the 1982 Nobel prize, Gabriel Garcia Marquez remarked, "Ultimately, literature is nothing but carpentry. . . . Very little magic and a lot of hard work are involved." Gabo, nearing 80 now, still busts his hump. Memories of My Melancholy Whores (Knopf,$20) is told by a nameless newspaper columnist who, at age 90, after a bachelorhood spent fucking in brothels, finds his first love: a virgin prostitute, 14 years old.No doubt the work will be clucked at severely by reviewers of a tender age and gender--although perhaps not so severely as they peck at Messrs. Mailer and Roth and other old cocksmen who lack the protection of Third World cachet. But any actual sin would be committed only if they failed to see that Memories is an elegant, sturdy meditation on regret, isolation, decay, and the inevitable perversity of redemption.It also is hilarious. Poor Garcia Marquez never gets props for the comedy chops that mark him as a true heir of Kafka and Faulkner. Here, the narrator's libertine need is sublimated into his columns, while his beloved, her flower unplucked, sleeps--literally--through their affair. The old man never even knows her true name; he calls her Delgadina, after the daughter of an incestuous king in an old song."That isn't her name," protests her madam."Don't tell me," says the narrator. "For me she's Delgadina.""All right, after all, she's yours, but to me it sounds like a diuretic." Ah, perfect love. As in One Hundred Years of Solitude, his masterpiece, the clarity, precision, and unblinking authority of his voice make Garcia Marquez one of the finest storytellers ever born. A table, too, can sometimes be a miracle.
75	Philip Larkin	Collected Poems of Philip Larkin	5/1/2005	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0504-MAYBIGBOOK	Esquire	Daniel Torday	ROBERT LOWELL WAS DRAGGED out of a Buenos Aires hotel in a straitjacket. Then there was stark-raving-mad old Ezra Pound in Italy, spewing anti-Semitism for Mussolini. But no poet's bad behavior has more blatantly influenced his work than Philip Larkin's. When he was 22, Larkin was so piss drunk at a literary reading that he mistakenly decided he was layered up enough to pee himself without anyone noticing. In his 30s, he gained notoriety around Britain's Hull University for his extensive porn collection. And his reputation was sealed when his collected letters revealed a lifelong litany of curse-strewn rants. All this while serving his entire adult life as a college librarian. Yes, one who wrote novels about lesbians and poems about casual sex, and could never really commit to a woman, lying and cheating even after he'd gone deaf and become his country's most famous poet. But a librarian, nonetheless. Twenty years after his death, a newly revised Collected  Poems (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14) has arrived to remind us that Larkin was more the man's poet of the 20th century than Bukowski or Kerouac. Who else could have had the balls to declare to the staid, poetry-reading world lines like "When I see a couple of kids / And guess he's fucking her and she's / Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm / I know this is paradise" or "Books are a load of crap" or "They fuck you up, your mum and dad. / They may not mean to, but they do." They're the kind of disaffected aphorisms you might expect to find in the films of Neil LaBute, delivered with an honesty even Larkin's inheritors couldn't hope to replicate. Speaking about lying around after sex, Larkin notes, "Talking in bed ought to be the easiest," but instead, "It becomes still more  difficult to find / Words at once true and kind, / Or not untrue and not unkind." In "Aubade," he starts the night with alcoholism ("I work all day, and get half-drunk at night"), and once the sun rises, we find him wrapped up in thanatopsis ("Death is no different whined at than withstood").Unique among writers, the great poet is even granted the enviable liberty--and sad curse--of ignoring any audience but himself. Larkin spoke plainly and eloquently to that lonely man. And he spoke to him as his inner asshole, that crass, stubborn, and yet unavoidably lovable curmudgeon who tends to poke his head out at the most inopportune times.
76	Tom Perrotta	Little Children	3/1/2005	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0404-APR_BIGBOOK	Esquire	William Bowers	TOM PERROTTA, author of the novel Election (yup, the one that became the Alexander Payne movie), is a shrewd observer of toddler politics. But the kids in his new book, Little Children (St. Martin's, $25), are less  inspiration for the novel's title than a burden for the adults in the book to schlepp around. Or worse: One of the main characters in this novel bearing so seemingly innocuous a name is, well, a sex offender. But Little Children is much more than just a tale of felony exhibitionism. It's the story of a mottled group of suburban parents in various states of dissatisfaction with their variously suburban lives. To wit: Todd and Sarah are house spouses eager for an extramarital affair with each other. Mary Ann schedules her sex life with pre-TiVo rigidity. Larry, the discharged cop, is hell-bent on harassing Ronnie, the sex offender. Through all of this, Perrotta wisely refuses to condescend to the world he satirizes, and his masterful perspective-hopping provides the reader with a breezy omniscience over the characters' failures in life. The book is disarmingly funny but rueful; Perrotta handles his fictive offspring in just the same way Todd gazes at his deceived wife--not mockingly, but with "something sweeter and more complicated." And above all else, the book's screenplay speed makes it infinitely readable. Little Children is a brave novel about the ugly by-products of lives spent seeking a vanilla balance of leisure and structure. In the absence of a great social novel with something new to say about the horror, the horror, we could do worse than settle for Perrotta's engrossing, compassionate gossip.

77	Elliot Perlman	Seven Types of Ambiguity	2/1/2005	M	http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/ESQ0205MAHBBOOKS_P38_2	Esquire	Tyler Cabot	TO READ AUSTRALIAN author 's epic second novel, Seven Types of Ambiguity (Riverhead, $28), is to undergo a two-week therapy session. Woven around the kidnapping of a young child by his mother's ex-lover, the novel is divided into seven sections, each with a different narrator offering another  account of the story. (Think Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! set in a world where the stock market has replaced the plantation.) Perlman writes with such convincing simplicity--his sentences read like whiskey-fueled confessions--that you can't help but imagine being locked in a room with his characters, devising a plan to palliate their woes. Soon, though, their shortcomings begin to feel like your burden. As wires get crossed, your own boarded-up history starts pounding its way out; it's a short trip from the therapist's chair to the patient's couch. Perlman's implicit challenge is to sew together a fabric of truth: Why can't  Simon, an idealistic alcoholic, come to terms with the loss of his first love? Will the kidnapping of her child drive Anna  back to Simon? With each narration, however, reality becomes more elusive. We can't trust any of the narrators because they lean on their emotions too much. We can't trust ourselves because Perlman makes us care too much. In the end, the young lawyer turned novelist is simply proving a point: You may swear that you see your life with clarity, understand why she left you, and know what others see when you walk in the door. But you know what? You don't know shit. And you know what else? You probably never will. As we dig ravenously through Perlman's sentences, our charge is to sort fact from fiction, perception from actuality. It's a task as damning as it is enjoyable.  --TYLER CABOT Shameless Plugs: New Books from Esquire Writers Empire Rising (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, $25), by Thomas Kelly. An extraordinary thriller about the political gangsters, builders, and bullies who constructed the Empire State Building. Girl Trouble (Rayo, $25), by Christopher McDougall.

Photo: Courtesy of PublisherShe Knows JackIf anyone doubted Anjelica Huston's ability to produce another captivating memoir, Watch Me (Scribner) will set them straight. While the Oscar winner's highly personal first volume, A Story Lately Told (2013), chronicled her uniquely privileged (and uniquely fraught) childhood and adolescence in Ireland and her years as a fashion model in London and New York, the dishy book left fans and critics wondering: Where's Jack Nicholson?Here, Huston delivers the goods. Within a few pages, the 21-year-old ingenue is dancing with the 37-year-old roué, and their long, on-again-off-again relationship is launched. Jack might woo Huston with expensive trinkets one day, then ride off on the back of a pretty girl's motorbike another. Winking at the past through the lens of time, Huston gamely drops her mysterious veneer to reveal a vulnerable girl with a perpetually breaking heart. But, against this backdrop of "unrequited love," Huston's acting career takes off. With wry humor she remembers how being told that she was neither beautiful nor talented only heightened her ambition. With quiet pride, she describes winning her breakthrough role in Prizzi's Honor (1985), which opened the door to a long and impressive list of performances.Through pain (realizing that she'll never be able to have children; her final breakup with Nicholson) and considerable joy (her love-filled marriage since 1992 to the sculptor Robert Graham; her ultimately fulfilling, award-strewn career), Huston's tireless fascination with the world is thrilling: She never gets bored, and neither do we.

Photo: Courtesy of PublisherLast LaughNational Book Award winner Denis Johnson has brilliantly plumbed the mystical and the macabre in such works as Tree of Smoke (2007) and his instant classic Jesus' Son (1992). The Laughing Monsters (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) delivers a more commercial, post-9/11 tale of intrigue, deception, romance, and misadventure set in West Africa without losing Johnson's essentially poetic drive.

We Recommend
After 11 years away, hard-living operative Roland Nair returns to Sierra Leone, where "traitors and deserters can evaporate before your eyes," to reconnect with former business partner and self-styled soldier of fortune Michael Adriko. Joining them is Adriko's fiancée, Davidia St. Clair, a striking, sensuous PhD dropout from Colorado with brains, stamina, and an appetite for foreign adventure. Portents gather as this unlikely trio journeys to the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo to visit Adriko's formidable clan. The elusive Nair has come back on orders from his superiors but also because he loves "the mess. Anarchy. Madness. Things falling apart." But for the voluble Adriko, Africa is a place where, "in the midst of it, we make ourselves unreachable. A man can [still] choose a valley, one with narrow entrances—defensible entries—and claim it as his nation, like Rhodes in Rhodesia."With each twist, Johnson deftly ups the stakes while adding to the cavalcade of entrepreneurs, assassins, seers, and smugglers that populate the book, tuning us in to the roiling political realities and cultural complexities of Africa today. We meet, among others, a drunken Russian pilot, a Zulu dressed like an American rapper, Chinese technicians, and La Dolce, an unforgettable tribal queen.As Nair writes to Tina, his whip-smart confidante back home, while detained in Congo: "Sometimes you just get stuck. That's Africa. Then you're on your way again without any idea what happened, and that's Africa too." This visionary novel is always falling together, never apart. That's Johnson.Related: Fabulously Creepy Reads by 13 Women WritersRelated: The Must-Read Books of OctoberThis article appears in the November 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

The article appears in the October 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.The great American novelist Marilynne Robinson once said that she thinks writers write because they are "frustrated by the thinness and inadequacy of ordinary spoken language, of ordinary contact even with the people they know best and love best." Of course, plenty of fiction writers are trapped by the same problem: Their words don't ring true on the page, much less demystify human contact. So it is a beautiful, sharp, heartening, and heartbreaking experience to read Robinson, who really does what we're all trying to do: get down below quick, easy talk to understand people better than life ordinarily allows us to.Lila (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), Robinson's new novel, revisits Gilead, the Iowa town she described with piercing eloquence in Gilead (2004) and Home (2008), both set in 1956. From them we already know Lila as the wife of Congregationalist minister John Ames, a widower many years her senior, and the mother of their son, Robby. But in this book, which scrolls back decades and plumbs the postwar present simultaneously—toggling seamlessly between what people have been through and who they are now as a result is one of Robinson's magical skills—we learn a great deal more about Lila's lonely and precarious path to Gilead.

Marilynne Robinson; Photo: (c) Kelly Ruth Winter Reverend Ames narrated Gilead in a series of late-life letters to Robby—urgently, lovingly recording his own most important experiences, from the terror he felt as a child beholding his chronically angry "wild-haired, one-eyed" preacher grandfather to the overpowering joy he feels now, with his failing heart, watching Robby standing on the seat of his swing, "sailing higher than you really ought to, with that bold, planted stance of a sailor on a billowy sea."Lila, too, is an uncanny seer, alert to everything and everyone around her. Like Glory Boughton, the lovelorn woman at the center of Home, who returned to Gilead to look after her dying father, Ames' best friend since boyhood, Lila has been burned by callous men. Her anxious edge, we sense, will never be soothed away. The church ladies who have been slipping casseroles into the reverend's kitchen and starching his sheets for almost half a century rattle her to the core. And yet, possessing such a vivid startle response also makes Lila exceptionally keen to the gifts of care and human connection she's lucked into in Gilead: Having once been homeless, she sees husband and son with the kind of heightened clarity that comes from surviving true hardship.Above all, Lila is a gorgeous love story, slowly unspooling both the heat and the herky-jerky progress of John and Lila's unlikely courtship. From the moment she stumbles into his church, seeking shelter during a downpour, Lila is deeply attracted to him: "You're a pretty fine-looking man, old or not," she blurts out soon after they start talking. John, likewise, is turned inside out by Lila. When she balks at their plan to marry, she sees "a kind of haste in his cheerfulness. She had hurt him, and he couldn't quite hide it." Right there, in that moment of Lila's acute perception followed by regret, Robinson shows us how people, coming into contact, manage the thrill and fear of closing the gap between them.We don't yet know whether Robinson has another Gilead story in the works. But let's hope she does. In this noisy, rushed age, we need all the more urgently her singular ability to quiet the din and home in on the things that matter.

Photo: Courtesy of PublisherNonfiction: The long, fraught saga of the invention of the birth-control pillNear the end of Jonathan Eig's The Birth of the Pill (Norton), a well-researched account of what went into making oral contraception available to the masses, a socialite turned activist named Katharine McCormick walks into a California pharmacy in 1959 with a prescription for Enovid, a new drug that will soon become so popular it will be known simply as "the Pill." It was a straightforward transaction, but it reflected a society on the cusp of drastic upheaval, not to mention the pinnacle of her life's work. Eig's narrative is full of such telling moments (in 1923 McCormick returned from Europe with eight trunks filled with the latest fashions, 1,000 diaphragms sewn into the clothes). Taken together, they make for a tale of scientific progress and social change as engaging and gripping as any suspense novel.Today the birth-control pill is so ubiquitous that it's easy to forget its advent was hardly inevitable. But Eig vividly re-creates the world of the early 1900s, a time when the best advice a doctor might have for a woman desperate not to have another child was to sleep on the roof. Even in the '40s, the quest for oral contraception was considered futile by many and amoral by most. Among the dissenters were the members of the unlikely quartet at the center of this story: millionairess McCormick, controversial medical researcher Gregory Pincus, feminist firebrand Margaret Sanger, and John Rock, a Catholic doctor whose impeccable reputation lent the cause much-needed legitimacy.

We Recommend
Eig's prescient book is worth reading for the trivia alone (horrifyingly, Lysol was once used as a contraceptive), but it also serves a weightier purpose. Its nuanced look at the Pill's beginnings puts the current reproductive-rights wars in historical context, and in so doing serves as a reminder that while Enovid did change the world—the ability of women to defer childbirth helped usher in the sexual revolution and second-wave feminism, drastically altering family structure and women's career ambitions—much has in fact remained the same. —Molly Langmuir

Spanning some 15 years and 5,000 miles, Yelena Akhtiorskaya's debut novel, Panic in a Suitcase (Riverhead), thrusts readers into the Nasmertov family with the sensory overload of an immigrant's arrival at Ellis Island. It is 1993, and Pasha—a 37-year-old Odessan poet who feels most comfortable in circles that judge a woman first for preferring Tolstoy to Dostoevsky, and second for having "teeth so large her lips didn't meet"—is visiting his recently immigrated parents and sister in their New York City home. Capturing the irritations and intricacies of family life with Nabokovian humor and wit, the novel eavesdrops on the Nasmertovs as they encounter obstacles both minute and grand: Pasha loses an oar while out rowing; his mother has exhausted the possible treatments for her worsening cancer.Related: Amy Bloom's 'Lucky Us' Starts With a BangThe Nasmertovs come so fully to life that when the novel's second half leaps ahead to revisit them more than a decade later, it feels as if we're catching up with old friends. Following Pasha's niece, Frida, once a stocky nine-year-old, on a trip to Ukraine at age 24, we feel a gossipy pleasure in watching peripheral figures reappear in central roles: He left his wife for that woman, from that party?In beautiful and sympathetic style, Akhtiorskaya's particular way of recording the world gets at capital T Truth without a hint of sentimentality, achieving the intangible literary goal of showing our oft-banal world in a familiar yet astonishing light.Related: Why Sue Miller's 'The Arsonist' Is This Summer's Must-Read Whodunit NovelThis article appeared in the August 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

The ironies in Lucky Us (Random House), Amy Bloom's latest marvelous picaresque entertainment, begin with the title and proliferate rapidly from there on forked paths and forked tongues. And yet, and yet…Bloom's bewitching world is such that the title can also, when all is said and done, be given an absolutely straight reading.Eva Logan's mother deposits Eva at age 12 with her baby daddy—dapper, worldly Professor Edgar Acton—in the town of Windsor, Ohio, and disappears. Eva discovers she has a half sister—Iris, 16—whose mother has just died. Iris is quite a piece of work, a compulsive and ambitious speechifier and performer; and Dad turns out to be both more and less than, and in any case altogether peculiarly different from, what he had seemed. So, tiring of his act, the girls sneak off on a bus to Hollywood in 1941, where in short order Iris manages to become "an MGM artist," while Eva, now a high school dropout and still only in her mid-teens, does her best to be her sister's helpmeet. And that's just in the first 20 pages.

We Recommend
Needless to say, we're nowhere remotely near Happily Ever After, and following this fizzy prelude, our heroines' prospects darken, brighten, and darken again with every turn of Bloom's cosmic kaleidoscope. Parades of finely drawn characters—a Spanish makeup artist, a black jazz singer afflicted with vitiligo, a lovely Italian nouveau riche family in Great Neck, New York, a soulful German mechanic—enter and leave the scene. In time, Eva emerges as having an unerring moral compass—even as she becomes a fortune-teller to make ends meet. Why does she do it? Because, as her father says, "the stars do fuck-all for us; you must make your own way."To read Bloom's fiction is to experience afresh how life is ruled by chance and composed of spare parts that are purposed and repurposed in uncanny ways—it's a festival of joy and terror and lust and amazement that resolves itself here, warts and all, in a kind of crystalline Mozartean clarity of vision.This article appeared in the August 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

"When a person is changing, as I am, at what point are they no longer who they were?" Frankie Rowley's father asks her one afternoon. For Alfie, the question posed is especially disturbing—the former professor's polymath mind is deteriorating rapidly—but it's one that often shadows Sue Miller's novels. What in our life defines us? Defunct marriages and wanderlust play central roles, whether viewed through the eyes of a philandering politician's spouse in The Senator's Wife (2008) or a conflicted parent in The Good Mother (1986), and Miller's latest novel, The Arsonist (Knopf), is no exception as the Rowley family navigates a tense summer in a small New Hampshire town.Frankie, who has spent the past 15 years doing aid work in Africa, arrives in Pomeroy at the beginning of a spate of unsolved arsons. Against the backdrop of a town that's literally going up in flames, she is confronted with feelings of inadequacy upon beholding her sister's happy young family, her parents' distressed and disintegrating bond, and the arsons' erosion of an already fraught relationship between Pomeroy's locals and its summer-only "flatlanders." But there is new growth, too. She meets Bud Jacobs, a former DC journalist who owns the local paper, and the two begin a languorous romance that Miller's adroit maneuvering allows us to view with a satisfying ease from both his outlook and hers.

Related: ELLE's Lettres June 2014 Readers' PrizeMultiview novels—whodunits especially—can feel gimmicky, but Miller avoids this pitfall by eschewing easy cliff-hangers or narrative deceits. The momentum grows instead from her compassionate handling of these characters; even a wife wishing for the early death of her husband is treated with authorial fairness. When Frankie, frustrated, tries to stop Bud from praising her years spent in Nairobi—her motivations for being there, she says, are "really complicated," selfish even—he refuses to let her diminish herself. "We're coming at this from different places," he says simply. Not all questions are answered, nor all mysteries solved, but the end of the book is imbued with the same quiet energy that's been building throughout; it's not happy, exactly—that would be too easy—but, in true Sue Miller fashion, it's triumphant.Related: Dorothy Parker's Still Got itThis article appeared in the July 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

Rivka Galchen, a sometime ELLE contributor, finds the perfect medium for her postmodern subject matter—from existentially rattling phone calls about Chinese takeout to a newly sprouted appendage and furniture that moves itself out—in the 10 stories that comprise American Innovations (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). This collection, which like her 2008 novel, Atmospheric Disturbances, responds to and echoes the surreal playfulness of the likes of Gogol and Borges, satisfyingly packages her wit and absurdist inclinations. Galchen plunges us into head-scratching romantic and domestic scenarios with untrustworthy guides, then yanks us right back out, leaving us gasping for breath, unsure of what exactly has happened.We're led through this skewed universe by lonely women in broken or breaking relationships who define themselves by what they're not doing—not making spaghetti, not surfing the Internet, not feeling like crying behind the boiler in the basement. Perhaps most affecting is "Wild Berry Blue," an adult's account of first love from a little-girl perspective: so many "accumulated moments of being nothing." She reflects, "All my life love has felt like a croquet mallet to the head. Something absurd, ready for violence. Love." You said it, sister.

The recently unemployed fabulist of "The Lost Order" describes herself as "a daylight ghost, a layabout, a mal pensant, a vacancy"; the grad student in "The Region of Unlikeness" who meets a so-called time expert with a scientific secret feels like "the most unredeemed of ghosts"; the tenant of "Real Estate" occupies her aunt's eerie apartment building because she spotted her dead father in the neighboring gyro shop and gets "the sense that ghosts like to return to the same places." While the women congratulate themselves on their rationalism, their voices betray their faltering grip on it.Related: The Terrifying Power of the SubconsciousLife mirrors chess, the dystopian writer in "The Late Novels of Gene Hackman" contends, as we slide our knights from the "square of reason" to the "square of paranoia."

From gritty Fourth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, I step inside the cozy Café Zona Sur to talk with Katherine Faw Morris about her adrenaline rush of a debut novel, Young God (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), which is already garnering heady praise and serious international buzz. I walk past a young woman with long blond hair who's wearing an animal-print jacket, skinny jeans, knee-high boots, and blue-glitter nail polish. Bold eyeliner makes her almond-shape eyes pop when she looks up from checking her phone. Her vibe is more edgy than Morris' chignon-coiffed author photo.But then she approaches me and introduces herself. Poised, confident, and direct, the 30-year-old Morris cops to this being her first sit-down interview for Young God and says, "It's the first book I ever finished." A stark, seductive coming-of-age tale about ambitious, rebellious 13-year-old Nikki, the novel spans one wild summer in the drug, violence, and poverty-ridden Appalachian hills that Nikki calls home. Bravely, Morris trimmed the story down from 100,000 to 22,000 raw, tense, and poetically incandescent words. Reading it is like having a bottle rocket go off in your hands.

Related: 'Room' Author Emma Donoghue Is Back With a New, Thrilling Novel"Nikki is all to hell," it begins. "A boy jumps off the cliff in front of her. She peers over the edge, watching him go.""Nikki.""She clenches her toes. The river is druggy and yellow and slugs next to the bottom road for miles before suddenly whipping itself into rapids and dumping, white and frothy, over the edge of this cliff."Related: 'Family Life': A Novel That Reads Your MindLike Nikki, Morris hails from northwestern North Carolina; unlike her heroine, Morris' family was not impoverished. Her father ran an insurance business, and her mom liked to take Morris and her two siblings traveling. Growing up, Morris volunteers, she had not one but two imaginary friends—Tuesday and Thursday. "I don't remember what they looked like, but they were powerful presences. As a writer, the way I think about stories comes from my film-school background—but I've also always had a camera in my head."I wanted to write a story about a young girl who is not a victim, even when everything in her life has gone wrong," Morris says about Young God. "I wanted her to be someone who was in charge. I really wanted her to be a queen of the underworld. It's summer and she's 13, that time when everything's happening." Morris says her own revolt came in response to her parents' divorce when she was 11 but was also fueled by her own "innate rage." Soon she was dating "guys in their twenties" with cars who introduced her to all the risky pleasures and lethal dangers that mark the divide -between Appalachia's haves and have-nots.At 17, the precocious, adventurous Morris left the rugged region to study film at New York University; after one semester she transferred to NYU's Gallatin School, where she got a liberal-arts degree, and then earned an MFA in writing from Columbia University. Seven years ago she married Donald Morris, creative director of the hip-hop monthly The Source. The couple lives in Sunset Park with their two pit bulls, Fela (as in Kuti) and Meyer (as in Lansky), who are Morris' boon companions when she's at home working on her second novel. These powerful dogs are in no way imaginary; they are the real deal, possessing intelligent reflexes and headstrong brawn—like their focused mistress, an old soul who can rock a hard-core urban style.This article appeared in the May 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

For her family-history homework assignment, a Houston schoolgirl asks her grandmother about escaping Vietnam by boat because "that's an A-plus story!" Grandma, non-plussed by this mercenary request, tells instead of her honeymoon voyage at age 16 with her hungover fisherman husband, who heedlessly took her out to sea and into the teeth of a gale. As they come to fear for their lives, something approaches dancing across the roiling waters: a corpse, "ribbons of kelp threaded among the white bones of its rib cage," yet "a little too alive to be completely dead." The newlyweds escape death but are left wondering whether a debt has thus been incurred to the spirit world, one that it "would eventually come collecting." Why can't you tell me how you escaped Vietnam? the schoolgirl asks. The grandmother replies, "It's simple, child: Did we ever really escape?"This schoolgirl is a stand-in for Violet Kupersmith, the 24-year-old author of The Frangipani Hotel (Spiegel & Grau), whose mother fled Vietnam by boat and married an American man. In this auspicious volume, Kupersmith has reshaped and womanhandled traditional Vietnamese folktales that her grandmother told her into a wildly energetic, present-tense fusillade of short stories: We meet, among others, a clerk at a Hanoi hotel where one attractive guest's presence goes oddly unnoticed by others, except a dashing American businessman with a tinted-window SUV, much to his eventual regret, and a young U.S. consular official whose American-émigré boyfriend's casual sexual history with local women sends her a little bit around the bend.

In perhaps the most pungent story here, a young woman who works the graveyard shift stocking shelves at Kwon's World Grocery in suburban Houston befriends an old man she finds standing naked beside a Dumpster.

At the beginning of sometime ELLE contributor Akhil Sharma's bracingly vivid second novel, Family Life (Norton), eight-year-old Ajay Mishra moves with his mother and brother from Delhi, where boys play cricket in the middle of the street, science feels like magic, and turning on the radio feels supernatural, to join his father in Queens, New York. Once he arrives, hot water running out of a tap gives Ajay the sense that he is living in a fairy tale, but soon reality cuts in—first in the form of bullying, at a school where he is so confused that his mind feels foggy, and then with an accident that leaves his brother severely brain damaged.Almost uncomfortably frank about the at times unsavory forces that roil within us (at one point Ajay is momentarily thrilled by the thought that his brother might die, since it would mean he'd get to be the only son), Family Life follows Ajay as he struggles to navigate a world in which he feels profoundly displaced—as an immigrant, as a person dealing with tragedy, and also, more generally, as a human being. He prays to a God whom he imagines looks like Clark Kent, lies about the details of his brother's life because the truth is often too horrible to speak aloud (or because he wants a girl to kiss him), and eventually discovers writing, which offers a reprieve. The novel is semi-autobiographical—Sharma himself emigrated from India as a boy and had an elder brother who suffered brain damage. But where reality ends and fiction begins doesn't really matter. The book has the ring of all devastatingly good writing: truth.Related: Lydia Davis Delivers Drama With Her Intimate New BookRelated: ELLE Readers Pick the Must-Read Books for AprilRelated:  A Book To Deconstruct the Work-Life Balance

Maggie Shipstead's new novel, Astonish Me (Knopf), swaps the privileged world of private-school prepsters that populated her best-selling debut, Seating Arrangements, for the equally rarefied realm of professional ballet— brilliantly exposing its dark, slavish underbelly with insight and panache. Spanning the early 1970s to the early 2000s, the story jumps between New York, Chicago, California, and Paris, where company ballerina Joan Joyce meets and has a one-night stand with her Soviet Svengali, renowned soloist Arslan Rusakov. Eventually she helps Arslan to defect, meeting him in Toronto and secreting him to New York City. As they hole up together in her small Chelsea apartment, Joan "watches him with a hoarder's eye," fearful of the day when "he will see her in the corps, no longer his rescuer but one of many identical girls, a bit of background...and she will see him not as the man who smokes in her bed and wallows in her bathtub and splays naked in her armchair, flipping through the English-Russian dictionary, but as she had first seen him: onstage, removed, at the spinning center of everything."In America, Arslan's already stellar career keeps soaring while Joan's steadily withers. She becomes pregnant, leaves the company, and marries Jacob, her "reasonably handsome, affable" best friend from home who had pined for her since high school. They move to California, where Joan gives birth to a son, Harry, and opens a dance studio, while Jacob becomes a teacher. Young Harry eschews dance and sports until he unexpectedly blossoms into a ballet prodigy whose classical-dance contacts eventually come to include the now world-famous Arslan.

We Recommend
Shipstead's handling of her characters is supple and satisfying. The triumphs and mistakes they make onstage mirror the movements and missteps they make offstage. As in life, "Love in a ballet is something that does not exist and then suddenly does, its beginning marked by pantomime, faces fixed in rapture, a dance. After, when they are hidden in the wings or behind the curtain, the dancers will grimace like goblins, letting the pain show."Related: Why You Should Read Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novel 'The Goldfinch'.

Prior to Room, her 2010 megaseller, Emma Donoghue had made a name for herself in historical fiction. Frog Music (Little, Brown) returns to that genre, bringing to steamy life the unresolved so-called San Miguel Mystery. It's summer 1876, and post-goldrush San Francisco has fashioned itself into the Paris of the West. It's fitting, then, that it attracts a trio of French excircus stars: Blanche, a onetime equestrienne, dances burlesque (and entertains michetons, or johns) to support her lover, Arthur, a trapeze maestro turned layabout "fancy man," and his partner in crime, Ernest. When Blanche gets bowled over by a bicycle steered by one Jenny Bonnet, she registers the crop-haired young woman as her antithesis: Jenny prefers menswear (and has been jailed for it), traps frogs for restaurants, and packs a Colt. But Jenny's gadfly influence spurs Blanche to reexamine her life—and brings lethal trouble.Donoghue front-loads the drama by opening with Jenny's murder, then alternates between Blanche's present-tense search for who she thinks did it and flashbacks that reveal why. She captures San Francisco ("all hills, like a featherbed a giant's shaken up and left one crumpled mess") in all its melting-pot, fishy-smelling glory, and weaves in authentic details about smallpox outbreaks, race riots, and orphanages. Jenny Bonnet is an incendiary character pulled directly from the history books, but, as Donoghue concedes, she's not quite the "proto-trans outlaw" celebrated in accounts on the Internet. Still, her extraordinary life gives Donoghue's novel contemporary resonance. She writes of the two not-so-dissimilar damaged women's love: "Same old notes, Blanche thinks at one point, but arranged into an unfamiliar music."Related: Pages From Mona Simpson's 'Casebook'Related: 10 Best Biographies of Literary WomenRelated:  A Book To Deconstruct the Work-Life Balance

Donna Tartt has won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for her novel The Goldfinch. A work of popular fiction written by a woman winning the Pulitzer? Yes. We couldn't be more thrilled. If you haven't already read The Goldfinch, maybe Boris Kachka's review will do the trick. Leave it to a minor character to nail the glorious trickery of The Goldfinch—both the 1654 oil masterpiece by Carel Fabritius and the book named for it, Donna Tartt's somewhat implausible, wholly entrancing third novel from Little, Brown. "They make jokes. They amuse themselves," says an art smuggler, referring to Fabritius and his Dutch peers. "They build up the illusion, the trick—but, step closer? It falls apart into brushstrokes. Abstract, unearthly. A different and much deeper sort of beauty." The same could be said of Tartt's impasto of lush writing and smudgy plotting. All writers of fiction ask us to suspend our disbelief, but Tartt sends it on extended leave—as long as it takes to submit to nearly 800 pages of picaresque sleight of hand.

We Recommend
Tartt's first novel, The Secret History, published 21 years ago, was a taut exercise by comparison. A highbrow murder mystery involving a cult of privileged classics students at a Bennington-type college, it became a global best-seller and a marketing reference point for every aspiring suspense writer with a history degree. It was a tough act to follow, and Tartt took her time—10 years of it. Her follow-up, The Little Friend—rooted in Tartt's Southern childhood and indebted to Faulkner and Harper Lee—was an endearing adventure, but, to some, disappointingly earthbound and desultory.Related: Is The Goldfinch the Next Hunger Games?Eleven years after that, The Goldfinch returns us to the haughty, ethereal terrain of The Secret History—antiques, Europhiles, drug cocktails, despair—but broadens the scope. Tartt cites Dickens as a major influence, and Oliver Twist is an obvious model for antihero Theo Decker's wild ride. Only imagine that Oliver became one of Fagin's eager thieves, driven by nihilism and an artful-dodger buddy named Boris."If suffering makes noble, then he is a prince," Boris says of Theo in his Ukraine-via-Vegas English. The Goldfinch begins, like every Tartt novel, with murder most gruesome: a terrorist attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where 13-year-old Theo's mother has just explained to him the title painting's art-historical import (Fabritius was Rembrandt's student and Vermeer's teacher). The bomb goes off, mother dies, and Theo steals the priceless painting accidentally on purpose. After a stint with a rich schoolmate's family, he finds himself in Las Vegas in the care of his deadbeat father. (The Goldfinch is lousy with horrible dads.) Also on tap are a drug-dealing stepmother, glue-sniffing petty thief Boris, and an American desertscape of mediocrity that seems to horrify Tartt as much as the bloodbath that led Theo there.Related: The 10 Best Thrillers and Crime Writing By WomenAnd we're not halfway through! Theo flees to New York City, lives in an antiques shop run by a kindly furniture restorer named Hobart, frets further about his purloined painting, pines for a fellow Met-bombing survivor named Pippa, and eventually reunites with Boris. Soon (but not soon enough), he becomes a more cultivated version of his gambler-druggie father, passing off Hobart's reconstructions—"beautiful young Frankensteins"—as Chippendale originals and learning that "even on the highest levels it was smoke and mirrors; everyone was furnishing a stage set."

We Recommend
The novel's range gives Tartt's sparkly writing the canvas it deserves. Hobart's shop is "a wilderness of gilt, gleaming in the slant from the dust-furred windows"; the Nevada sky "was wide and trackless, like the sky over the sea." I was ambivalent about the more broadly drawn Boris—yet another Slavic gangster caricature—but without his plot-driving energy and hilarious cranked-up fatalism, Theo's guilty monologues would be hard to bear.Even still, there are excess brushstrokes of allegory and analysis. We don't need to be told repeatedly that The Goldfinch is a fetishistic substitute for Theo's dead mother; that "there's no truth beyond illusion"; that the low light in Amsterdam, where the plot comes to its climax, evokes the many Dutch paintings that depict the low light in Amsterdam. The novel ideally would have rolled up at Tartt's usual 600 pages.And yet, where would we be if the novelist weren't as much of a scofflaw as her damaged antihero? Be concise; write what you know; avoid dream sequences. Tartt has no time for the schoolmarms. She's too busy crafting beautiful young Frankensteins out of the dust-furred antiques shop of Western culture, and then halfway convincing us they belong in the canon. Like Theo's customers, we want to be deceived, and no one obliges better than the mature Donna Tartt—perhaps not even her younger self.This article appeared in the November 2013 issue of ELLE magazine.

Reading a Lydia Davis story collection is like reaching into what you think is a bag of potato chips and pulling out something else entirely: a gherkin, a pepper corn, a truffle, a piece of beef jerky. Her stories look light and crisp, with their unadorned prose and flat-footed style, but on closer inspection they are pithy, knobby, savory, chewy, dense. They are also mordantly, slyly funny in their exposure of human foibles. Can't and Won't (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), her fifth collection, is evidence of a writer who is in total control of her own peculiar original voice; its pleasures are unexpected and manifold.Some of these stories are so short they could be poems. Rather than acting like hand grenades that detonate on impact and demand immediate rereading in order to fill in what's missing, these seem meant to be taken at face value; they expand narratively rather than emotionally. "The Language of the Telephone Company" reads, in its entirety, "The trouble you reported recently is now working properly"—a satirical commentary on corporate lingo's artificial, euphemistic rhetoric. Another story, "Contingency (vs. Necessity)," reveals the arbitrariness of dog loyalty (and of other things as well):

We Recommend
Related: ELLE Readers Pick the Must-Read Books for April"He could be our dog.But he is not our dog.So he barks at us."The longer stories turn inward, sinuously, with almost no dialogue or interpersonal interaction. Instead, we feel the mental workings of someone whom we assume to be Davis herself: The I of these stories seems intended to feel autobiographical, and this intimacy of voice is what makes them suspenseful, even when relatively little happens.Related: 12 Great Female Authors Recommend Their 40 Favorite Female AuthorsIn one of the longest stories of the collection, "The Seals," a woman mourns her sister during a long train ride, recalling one quirky, mundane detail after another. At the end, we glimpse the sister in a slipping half-light, as a refracted, yearned-for enigma, through the eyes of someone who loved but never truly knew her.Davis, a MacArthur Fellow who has also won a slew of the most prestigious literary awards and is an eminent translator from several languages to boot, shares with Samuel Beckett a sharp playfulness and antipathy toward ornamentation, as well as a tendency to subvert dramatic expectations that is, in the aggregate, startlingly dramatic.This article appeared in the April 2014 issue of ELLE magazine.

In The Last Days of California (Liveright), debut novelist Mary Miller follows the Metcalf family on a road trip from Alabama to the California coast, where they plan to await the Rapture. Miller portrays her characters—15-year-old Jess; her dangerously beautiful, secretly pregnant 17-year-old sister, Elise; and their prayer-loving parents—with an unwavering intensity as they traverse America's sprawling suburban no-man's-lands. Miller's prose bestows a magnetic beauty on gas-station bathroom stops, Waffle House lunches, and the cast of overfed, overstimulated travelers the Metcalfs encounter along the interstates. The story flows forth via Jess's deadpan inner monologue: "Our father said heaven was going to be perfect in a way we couldn't even begin to comprehend," she reflects, contemplating the prospect of the Rapture. "I was already young and healthy and surrounded by my loved ones and it didn't seem so great."Related: The "ELLE's Lettres" Readers' Prize Grand Prix Books of the YearMixing desire, rivalry, and vulnerability, Miller paints a plangent portrait of American adolescence. "At some point, my feelings for my parents had changed," Jess thinks at one hotel overnight. "I mostly felt nothing and couldn't think of anything to say to them, but it was periodically broken by a brief, crushing feeling, a love so intense that there was nothing to do but reject it altogether." And Jess is increasingly perplexed by her parents' faith. "It seemed silly that we were all moving around the world for no other reason than we could—cars and planes and boats taking people from one location to another as if we weren't all going to die," she muses as she stares at a seemingly infinite Arizona desert landscape. This is perhaps Miller's greatest strength: her ability to deliver raw the heartbreaking futility of the Metcalfs' small triumphs, private embarrassments, and poor decisions with such hilarious precision that you become completely involved in their struggles—and, ultimately, in awe of their abiding hope.

In the opening pages of Sarah Cornwell's bewitching first novel, What I Had Before I Had You (Harper), newly divorced Olivia Reed and her two children travel from Texas back to her hometown on the New Jersey shore. There, on the busy boardwalk in the gathering summer twilight, her troubled nine-year-old son, Daniel, vanishes. "Of course I would lose him here; this is where I lose people," Olivia says to herself. "My past is leaching into my present, and even in the midst of this panic, I feel a sensation of walking a few steps behind myself."Related: 10 Books To Read After A BreakupThe tension compulsively accrues as Olivia and her teen daughter, Carrie, aided by the police, search desperately for Daniel, whose bi-polar illness causes him to experience hallucinations, night terrors, and other symptoms of psychosis. Olivia, who suffers from a milder form of this disorder, finds herself catapulted into her own fragile, volatile past—specifically, the summer she ran away from home. "Twenty years have passed, and I have not set foot in New Jersey once. I don't know what made me think I could do it today casually, without consequence. For the truth is, here is the locus of my guilt. I left my mother here when she was sick and sad and alone. When I was 15, someone lowered a rope into my well, and I climbed it and pulled it up after me."

We Recommend
Related: 15 Books That Changed Women ForeverWe learn that Olivia's mother, Myla, was a beautiful psychic whose clients, mostly men from inland towns, came "to hear her read tarot or trace the future in their palms." On beach trips, while they sat together in the surf, Myla told Olivia that she could "hear the talk underneath talk," so Olivia believed her mother could read her thoughts "like a played hand of cards." More tragically, we learn that a scant year before Olivia was born, Myla had stillborn twins—ghostly sisters who claim a spooky, penetrating presence in this propulsive story.In chapters alternating between the puzzling, pressurized present and the eerily predictive past, Cornwell works the novel's double narrative with the deft touch of a magician and the sure hand of a confident writer to watch.

In The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P. (Henry Holt), debut novelist Adelle Waldman introduces us to neurotic, navel-gazing Nate Piven, a writer navigating the terrain—and, naturally, the women—of Brooklyn's literary demimonde. After years of effortful obscurity, Nate has landed the book deal of his dreams—but the same unflinching intellectual acuity that is propelling him to success threatens to ruin his love life: "When it came to dating," Waldman writes, "his intelligence often seemed like an awkward appendage that failed for the most part to provide him with whatever precisely was wanted—dry, cynical humor; gallantry; an appreciation for certain trendy novelists—but nonetheless made a nuisance of itself by reminding him when he was bored."Waldman lends an acerbic wit and a remarkable grasp of the male psyche to her rendering of Nate's ill-starred tumbles into the dating pool. "Nate had not always been the kind of guy women call an asshole," she writes. "Only recently had he been popular enough to inspire such ill will." This detestable yet lovable antihero quickly becomes irresistible to us as Waldman's sharp psychological insights yield spot-on portrayals of au courant politesse, cringeworthy personal interactions, and all-too-familiar interior monologues. The upshot: a thoroughly, hilariously of-the-moment tale that marvelously captures what it's really like to be young, smart, and looking for love in the big city—from a new writer to watch.

Ifemelu has to go into Trenton from Princeton to get her hair braided, and in the opening pages of Americanah (Knopf), Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's third novel, as she slips into a salon-chair reverie, we tumble back in time to her girlhood in Lagos, Nigeria. Adichie (Half of a Yellow Sun)—who has already won a MacArthur fellowship and the Orange, PEN/O. Henry, and-Commonwealth Writers prizes, to name but a few—thereafter unflaggingly holds us in her thrall with the tale of how Ifemelu got from there to here—and beyond.Ifemelu seems destined to come to the United States with her  secondary-school and college sweetheart, the sterlingly loyal and gently mischievous Obinze, who has shared with her his love of American literature and pop culture. But then Ifemelu wins a scholarship to a college in Philadelphia, while the American embassy slams the door on Obinze's hopes to join her, and Americanah splits painfully into parallel narratives. Obinze ends up going to London instead to try to make a go of working under a false identity while arranging to marry an EU citizen to obtain papers. (Staying in Nigeria, a land plagued by military coups, arbitrary authoritarianism, corruption, and endless academic strikes and disruptions, is all but unthinkable.)

We Recommend
So we mainly follow Ifemelu as she tries and repeatedly fails to find under-the-table work to support herself while in school; makes some desperate moral compromises in doing so; drifts through several relationships with sweet, worthy Americans that are doomed by her inescapable sense of "bleakness and borderlessness"—and, eventually, starts a blog called Raceteenth or Curious Observations by a Non-American Black on the Subject of Blackness in America that becomes an Internet sensation, landing her a humanities fellowship at Princeton.Thus does Americanah provide Adichie with a fictional vehicle for all kinds of pithy, sharply sensible commentary on race and culture—and us with a symphonic, polyphonic, full-immersion opportunity to think outside the American box and commune with the wholly global sensibility of Adichie, an author who truly contains multitudes. As for what happens to Obinze? Well, you have 477 glorious pages standing between you and the answer to that question.Liked this story? Get it first when you subscribe to ELLE magazine.

It's hard to miss the surface parallels between Sex and the City and Iris Has Free Time (Soft Skull), Iris Smyles' debut novel about an aspiring writer navigating life and love in the Big Apple. There's love interest Lex, an aging party boy whose commitment issues resemble those of Mr. Big more than a little, not to mention the narrator's punny turns of phrase—such as calling her alcohol-induced blackouts "pink-outs." At one point, she even writes a sex column for an online magazine.But it would be a mistake to dismiss Iris as a Candace Bushnell knockoff: Iris is roughly a decade younger than Carrie Bradshaw (the narrative runs from Iris' NYU commencement to her thirtieth birthday), and the novel's deeper themes dovetail far more with—to stick to HBO references here—Girls. The book has allusions to Friendster and the dot-com bubble that might seem downright archaic to Lena Dunham and her cohort, but the crux of the story—traversing the long, winding road toward adulthood—is one most millennials can relate to. (The title is a reference to Iris' chronic underemployment.) What's more, it seems that unlike Carrie, Iris isn't about to sign herself up for an extra decade of Peter-Pandom. As she asks after surviving a series of benders, "When did all these games stop being fun?"Liked this story? Get it first when you subscribe to ELLE magazine.

A long visit to Lionel Shriver's London townhouse is so uncomfortable it almost comes round to being cozy. "You might want to keep your coat on," the American expat novelist says, her breath fogging up the entryway. She refuses to use the gas heat ("they're price gougers") and rarely lights the woodstove before nightfall. Two hours later, she'll think to offer a cup of tea. She herself never eats until after evening calisthenics; bedtime is around 3 a.m. "I'm very routinized," Shriver explains. "I'm inflexible. Which is why we're not having lunch!" Her furrowed expression softens as she belts out a slightly smoky laugh, a relic of the one-per-day habit she recently traded in for an e-cigarette."Jeff gave me a really hard time about inviting you over to the house," she says later—meaning Jeff Williams, her jazz drummer husband of 10 years, whom she fictionalized in her best-selling novel The Post-Birthday World. "He said, 'He's just gonna criticize your furniture.' Which is worthy of criticism, by the way!" The living-room chairs are indeed faded and mismatched, but the place has its charms: a rough-hewn dining table, a vintage stove, and Shriver's own sculptures, which range from a figure in the fetal position to a dazed-looking woman in a bath.

We Recommend
Shriver's fictional characters are as odd and indelible as their creator. Most famously, there's the deeply flawed mother in her seventh published novel, We Need to Talk About Kevin, whose son ends up going on a killing spree at his high school. Published in 2003, the book became an "underground feminist hit," per one paper, then a genuine hit, and finally a literary totem of America's national insanity. In 2011, the book was turned into a haunting movie—and then, last year, there was the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Shriver supports gun control, but she has to keep reminding people that Kevin used a crossbow. Her novel wasn't about politics. "I was more interested in the pure malice itself," she says, "which is a larger question and more interesting and more literary—i.e., more my business."A big part of Shriver's business, across 11 novels, is to tear down the old literary wall between "big idea" fiction and the "personal" (read: feminine) variety. "All novelists write from personal experience," she says. "Reading the newspaper is a personal experience." But her own story does course beneath the surface of her books. Raised in North Carolina by a Presbyterian minister and a homemaker mother, the teenage Shriver forswore her given name—Margaret Ann—her religion, and, eventually, the South. After graduating from Barnard in 1978, she spent 15 years in difficult foreign locales before putting down roots in an unglamorous section of South London.Shriver's novels most often follow paths not taken, imaginary branches of her own life. Instead of having a child, she created the mother of a monster in Kevin. After deciding to leave her previous partner and marry Williams, she came out with The Post-Birthday World, which describes two alternate relationship-realities. And A Perfectly Good Family imagines what it might have been like if Shriver's parents had died, leaving the writer and her two brothers to wrangle over their inheritance.Her still-living parents responded to that novel with long, scathing letters threatening to disinherit Shriver. Her younger brother didn't talk to her for two years. Relations have since thawed, but, she says, "I don't think we have ever properly talked it out." And while she isn't apologetic—"nothing short of a hagiography would have sufficed"—she isn't immune to regret. When her parents finally do pass on, she says she'll feel "a sense of loss contaminated with a sense of guilt and culpability and inade­quacy and just generally feeling like a shithead."

We Recommend
Shriver's new novel, Big Brother (June, Harper), could easily be read as a reckoning—with not just familial regret but also her youthful faith in self-reinvention. Its real subject is her own black sheep older brother, Greg, her only family member to actually love A Perfectly Good Family. Big Brother's narrator, an Iowa woman named Pandora, gets a visit from her older brother, a down-and-out New York–based jazz pianist who's recently lost all his money and gained 223 pounds. Overriding both their former estrangement and her own tidy family, Pandora takes leave of her very thin husband in order to save her brother's life.

Along the way to a shattering conclusion, Shriver ponders our collective inability to stop obsessing about food. "You couldn't help but wonder," she writes, "what earthly good was a microprocessor, a space telescope, or a particle accelerator, when we had mislaid the most animal of masteries." Beneath the big ideas, Big Brother is also Shriver's most personal novel. "She can be merciless," says Gail Winston, Shriver's editor at HarperCollins. "But I think this shows a certain fragility and vulnerability that probably is somewhat new—mainly because of the backstory."In November 2009, Shriver was in her London kitchen when Greg's doctor called from New York. Her brother had become morbidly obese over the past decade, and, at 55, was in and out of the hospital. He had a genius IQ, she says, and was a successful sound engineer before his life went downhill. Shriver asked the doctor if Greg could handle gastric-bypass surgery, and he said yes—but he would need someone in New York to look out for him. Shriver owns a home in Brooklyn, where she and Williams spend their summers. "I just wondered, Did I have it in me? I wasn't sure." She pauses, raising her voice. "And then two days later he was dead. I never had to decide. I was never tested. I'm not much of an altruist. I felt guilty about my sense of relief."

We Recommend
"I don't think you're really a misanthrope," Williams tells his wife, having joined us in the frigid living room. She agrees, to a point. "I do not take an instant dislike to people. It's a generalized despair. Anyone who has gotten nearly to the age of 57 and not at least had a moment of loathing of her own species hasn't been paying attention." (She's actually 55.) Above Shriver's kitchen table is her "masterpiece," a framed collage of newspaper clippings: Police Taught How to Climb 3ft Ladder; Gardener Drowns in a Water Barrel; One in Ten Thinks That Life is Not Worth Living. "There are many themes to it," she says. "But I guess the larger point is how dumb life is."She also tends to yell at the TV news. Williams says the DVR has improved their experience, though pausing the program for Shriver's riffs on the topic du soir can stretch a 50-minute broadcast to an hour and a half. One recent rant came the Sunday after the Newtown massacre, during Obama's speech. "At no point," she remembers, "did he ever mention the mother," Adam Lanza's first victim. "There was in the omission the implicit accusation that she was culpable."Shriver says she had "more or less hung up my school-shooting hat," turning down writing assignments and talking-head gigs. "For me to constantly be consulted as an expert in school shootings is ludicrous. I made one up." But Obama's omission cut to the heart of We Need to Talk About Kevin, in which the mother suffers from knee-jerk ostracism. Moved, she wrote a column for The Guardian headlined The Scapegoating of Nancy Lanza.Though she doesn't love the label public intellectual, Shriver owes a lot of her British fame to columns and broadcast appearances, in which she serves as the designated American. "I'm definitely used as a mascot," she says. "I should have earned my way out of that category." She thinks that doing more U.S. journalism might help to raise her profile stateside, but she's hitched her wagon to England and is considering applying for UK citizenship—partly to be eligible for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. These are high-class dilemmas for a writer who published her first six novels in almost total obscurity. "By the time I wrote Kevin," she says, "it was make-or-break. If I did not publish that book, I couldn't keep writing books." She submitted Kevin just after September 11, an inauspicious time to pitch violent stories. Her American literary agent rejected it on the basis that it was unquestionably too dark. (Shriver got revenge, of sorts, when she married Williams, that agent's ex-husband.)

We Recommend
Eight months later, Shriver found a new agent, Kim Witherspoon, who wanted to represent the novel. "There was such tremendous clarity and honesty about the thoughts that many women have as they're anticipating motherhood," says Witherspoon, who was pregnant at the time. Kevin eventually won Britain's Orange Prize and has now sold well over a million copies in English. Her subsequent novel, The Post-Birthday World, also hit the best-seller list."I think the late bloomer is much more fortunate than the early bloomer," says Shriver. "I'd definitely choose my story over Jay McInerney's…. I always felt sorry for those people. Okay, also envious: Give me that kind of break, and I'll do something with it! I wouldn't be scared of it, because I'd keep having ideas."Shriver's books live or die by the currency of those ideas. The Post-Birthday World, consumed with women's romantic choices, was a book-club shoo-in, especially on the heels of Kevin. But her next novel, So Much for That—a critique of the broken American health-care system—was a tougher sell. "It swept the Oscars, in terms of the reviews," Shriver says. But "people don't want to buy a book about illness." Even the passage of Obamacare the month it was published didn't help. "Illness," she concludes, "reminds people of the fact that they're going to die."Shriver places some of the blame on her bind as a woman writer. A couple of Britain's major booksellers insisted on a softer cover for So Much for That. ("It's an outrage—it has a lily on it. A fucking flower! It's a very hard-ass book…. I treasure the male readership my work has garnered, and I think it's been artificially suppressed.") One cover she does approve of is for the novel that came next, The New Republic: a picture of a cigarette in an ashtray.

We Recommend
In fact, Shriver wrote The New Republic in the late '90s but failed to find a publisher for it at the time. So she decided to use her newfound clout to publish it last year. It's a high-flown farce about terrorism, of all things, drawing from Shriver's years in Troubles-era Belfast. Before September 11, its problem might have been that no one took the subject very seriously. But in 2012 it faced a new obstacle: Terrorism was taken, Shriver thinks, too seriously. The New York Times' Michiko Kakutani, generally a Shriver fan, called The New Republic "cringe-making" for its "willfully breezy depiction of terrorism"—in short, "a ghastly novel.""I had to pay a price for it," Shriver admits, though not regretfully. "I am pleased that it did seem to find some people who got it, who responded to it, who understood it." Winston, Shriver's editor, laughs uneasily when that novel comes up: "I think I'll pass on that one." The decision to publish it, with an awkward author's note, was not hers. But Winston doesn't believe it hurt Shriver's career: "No one will ignore her ever again."Big Brother displays a subtle sensitivity to a broader readership. At Winston's suggestion, Shriver went light on the sorts of gruesome medical descriptions that may have held back So Much for That. While she insists that her writing hasn't changed a bit, her attitude certainly has. "When I was younger, what I wanted was a pat on the head," she says. "Now, if you gave me a choice—the critics will hammer you but it will be a best-seller; or you can have all the plaudits in the world, and nobody will buy it—I'd rather have the sales."

We Recommend
Shriver wrangled with Winston about the more big-idea-focused sections of Big Brother, which she calls "mini essays." "I call it ranting," says Winston, "and these rants are the subject of our push-pull." But Winston usually relents, recognizing the gift of a noisy novelist: "I'm of the less-is-more school, but she knows how to turn up the volume. Not everyone knows how to turn it up. Some publishers say of a book, 'Well, it's a quiet book.' That's not her problem at all."A few hours after our first meeting, we reconvene for a late dinner in the quiet Giaconda Dining Room, an old continental place just modern enough for its Soho environs. A publisher took Shriver here once, and she liked it enough to overcome her indifference to dining out."My general experience of restaurants is disappointment or apathy," she says. "If I couldn't have made it myself, then I could also probably live without it." Willliams, when asked what might surprise people about Shriver, tells me, "She's one of the sweetest people I've ever known." His evidence is her generous cooking, including an elaborate sushi meal she made him before they began dating. Shriver has one fatal flaw as a cook—too much spice for most palates. "Subtlety," she says, "is not my forte." Which is another problem with restaurant food: "It's awfully bland."Shriver bikes everywhere, no matter the weather, and her fancy Trek bike—a rare indulgence—is locked up in front of the restaurant. In the three hours between interviews, she's made an apple raspberry crumble, done her calisthenics, and changed right back into the same clothing: a black mock turtleneck, stretchy black pants, and the plainest of white sneakers. "Every once in a while," she says, "I decide to look good, and when I decide to look good, I look fantastic. And the rest of the time, I don't give a shit."

We Recommend
Shriver's mind is already on her next novel—or two. She's been dissuaded, for now, from writing about immigration, on which she has some impolitic opinions. "If it's just a matter of there being an Indian restaurant down the block, that's all to the good," she says. "If your entire neighborhood is full of people who don't speak your language anymore…you feel taken over." She adds, quickly, "I'm an immigrant too. And one of the reasons I find this issue interesting is exactly those kinds of contradictions." She is hesitant to discuss her in-progress novel—but she can't help herself. It's a dystopian family drama set in a near-future United States, following the collapse of the dollar. The deficit, as it happens, is one of those topics about which she can speak knowledgeably, loudly, and at great length. A proud libertarian, she finds Ron Paul's platform "very attractive," despite its flawed messenger. By the time our appetizers arrive, she's on to a full-blown mini essay. ("What else are we gonna call it? It is corrupt! Congress is corrupt!")Maybe it's the bottle of red wine, but when the topic returns to Big Brother, Shriver becomes overwhelmed with compassion for everyone who suffers from obesity—their failures, uniquely, out there for all to see. "I'm also sympathetic with people who just weigh a little too much and then ruin their lives over it." Shriver controls her weight with her usual zeal. Only once, she says, did she let herself go. At age 17, she traveled through Britain with a friend, and "I must have gained 10 pounds. It was horrifying. So that was my walk on the wild side."

We Recommend
The ultimate source of Shriver's empathy—for her real brother, for the people in Big Brother, and for all of her characters, even the homicidal ones—is her instinctive disdain for moderation. "I'm a naturally very greedy person," she says, "so I am sympathetic with other people who are greedy. It has a bad reputation, the whole business of having appetite. I like having appetite." The most important "big idea" in Big Brother appears toward the end of the book, and reads, simply, "We are meant to be hungry.""I think that's probably the best line of the book," Shriver says. "I want to be hungry. My version of total misery is eating three meals a day and having a biscuit in the afternoon. You're never hungry, and you always feel slightly sick—or I do. And you never feel you really deserve it."While she talks, Shriver decides that her mixed fish grill is underseasoned. Pulling from her bag a small plastic canister of Turkish hot-pepper flakes, she buries the dish in a half-inch-thick layer of the stuff. The brill, sole, and scallops on her plate have gone from a delicate cream color to a garish red. "I can't tell you," she says with her mouth full, "how much it picks up the dish."Liked this story?

I first met and fell in love with Junot Díaz's voice in his 2007 novel, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The slangy, profane, thesaurus-biting Spanglish of his narrator, Yunior, swung from high to low like nothing else I'd ever read. Oscar was anutterly original hereo, too: a nerd of color, a fat comic-book- and Tolkien-loving romantic virgin who could check both the black and the Hispanic boxes but who fit in nowhere. Yunior describes Oscar as "a social introvert who trembled with fear during gym class...and used a lot of huge-sounding nerd words like indefati­ gable and ubiquitous...."Reading the Pulitzer Prize–winning Oscar Wao is like hanging out with a caffeinated raconteur. Yunior's narrative jumps from Oscar, in New Jersey, to his sister, Lola, and then back to the early life of their mother, Belicia, whose parents and sisters were likely killed in the Dominican Republic by dictator Rafael Trujillo's thugs and who was then mistreated by her guardians.Díaz told Slate that writing short stories requires a "precision and ruthlessness," whereas novel writing is "all about the embrace." And Oscar Wao is indeed warmer and looser than his debut story collection, Drown (1996), or his new one, just out, This Is How You Lose Her, which is comprised of stories about men who cheat on their women. Most of the stories in both books are narrated by Yunior, but we don't get to know any of the women in them as well as we do Oscar Wao's Lola and Belicia.

We Recommend
Yunior isn't Díaz any more than Rabbit is Updike; well, maybe a little more. Let's say Yunior isn't Díaz any more than Zuckerman is Philip Roth. Like Díaz, Yunior moved to New Jersey from the DR as a child. Both had a big brother who was struck early by cancer. Rage at Trujillo's atrocities permeates Oscar Wao, so I was surprised to learn that Díaz's father was a military policeman for Joaquín Balaguer, the autocrat who succeeded Trujillo. Díaz has said his father hit his four sons and encouraged him to be an "aggressive, violent hombre." In 1974, the family moved to New Jersey, where Díaz's father drove a forklift. "He was constantly being laid off—and wasting his money on other women," Díaz says. "My mother took care of us until my father scrammed, and then she ended up working in the small-factory sector of New Jersey with a lot of other immigrants." He remembers the poverty there as "exceptionally lonely" compared with that in the DR—a loneliness he captures in his books.Literature allowed Díaz to see beyond the limits of working-class New Jersey. In high school, reading Octavia E. Butler's Patternmaster and Stephen King's The Stand back-to-back first gave him the idea of becoming a writer. Then, he says, "When I read Toni Morrison and Sandra Cisneros as a freshman at Rutgers, it all clicked—that writing was all I wanted to do. It became my calling." He earned an MFA from Cornell in 1995, and worked as a temp in Manhattan at Pfizer until he sold Drown, He taught writing at Syracuse University from 1997 to 2002, then moved to his current post at MIT.When Díaz spoke with me, he was scheduled to have back surgery in five weeks and was in too much pain to sit, so he stood by the bar at the Royalton Hotel in Manhattan while we talked. He says he was drawn to write a book about cheaters because "infidelity raises profound questions about intimacy. Communion," with family, with friends, but especially with lovers, he says, is his "ontological vocation...like, what are you on this planet for?" He says most of the boys he grew up with also longed for communion, or intimacy. "But there's no intimacy without vulnerability—and what boy gets advanced training in vulnerability? You spend your whole life being trained that vulnerability is the opposite of your identity."Díaz explains how "lots of dudes" (including his characters) manage this crippling cultural imperative. "What do you do when you want something you can't achieve? You playact. What is cheating but playacting like you're in a relationship? You ain't in a fucking relationship if you're cheating. 'Cause you ain't vulnerable." He illustrates, touching my arm lightly, "If I'm dating you and I'm cheating, I'm not here. I am not vulnerable. It's like you and me being in the ocean together, which is what being intimate is. We are alone, swimming in the ocean of life, saying, 'At least we have each other.' But I got a life vest tucked between my legs while I'm saying it," he concludes with a big smile.

We Recommend
In the new collection's final story, "The Cheater's Guide to Love," Yunior's fiancée has broken off their engagement after discovering that Yunior, in their six years together, had cheated with "Fifty fucking girls? Goddamn." When I started reading it, I was excited to meet this adult version of Yunior, one who lives in many worlds—that of his Dominican and New Jersey peeps as well as his literary and collegiate circles—and who is in his forties and presumably knows lots of women, and some functional, egalitarian, monogamous couples as well. Finally, I thought, I'll meet a woman who isn't summed up as "big stupid lips and a sad moonface" or "this one piece of white trash from Sayreville" or "a big Dominican ass." But—no such luck.Díaz is an outspoken leftist, decrying economic and other inequalities from his position as fiction editor of the Boston Review. He calls sexism, along with racism and genocide, one of his major concerns as an activist and a writer. He calls Toni Morrison's harsh take on men "dead on" and uses "she" as his nonspecific pronoun. He refers to his writing as a "feminist-aligned project" achieved by "mapping male subjectivities." I do not doubt that he is sensitive to the ways women are marginalized; it seems appropriate to ask him about the sexism in the new collection.When I tell him that some of the book made me flinch, Díaz goes all professorial, explaining (unnecessarily) that a narrator is not the same as the writer. "Representing a subjectivity doesn't equate with approving the subjectivity," he lectures. "So the questions we have to ask about a piece of work are, What does our interaction with this subjectivity do for us? What is productive? What is the book rewarding or not rewarding?" Good questions all.

We Recommend
He makes another distinction that I'm down with: "If you have a book that represents a bunch of sexist, rapist lunatics and they all end up being awesome and wonderful and winning everything and the book is clearly affectionate to them, then this might be problematic. On the other hand, if a book has some pretty average guys, and their way of thinking about the world, about women, and their habits around intimacy and relationships don't produce positive results for them or for the women in their lives," then that is not problematic. He says that his new book "clearly shows the consequences. I don't see these guys winning."When I say his caught-with-their-pants-down narrators seem at most mildly, temporarily chastened and no closer to changing, Díaz replies, "Well, I'm not writing fairy tales or object lessons." I can't disagree, but the opening for a "productive interaction" with Yunior's subjectivity continues to shrink. Díaz's cheaters are charming, funny, desirous, and never go without a woman for long. They do sort of succeed, like the rapist lunatics in his example."The Yunior of the final story is absolutely nearly undone by the loss of intimacy," and that represents an evolution, Díaz says. Except that, by Díaz's own definition, if Yunior cheated with 50 "girls" during a six-year relationship, then he's never known a committed intimacy in the first place. I see no authorial empathy with the ex as a person who also suffers. I see Yunior having health problems, unable to keep a girlfriend, feeling sorry for himself, and taking solace in writing. I see all the other women summarily dismissed as "hot moms," prigs, and worse; I see two women trying to trick men into taking care of babies that are not their own.

We Recommend
I push Díaz again on how his fiction illuminates men's need to overcome deep programming to get to intimacy. Is anyone in the new book successfully intimate? "The idea isn't whether intimacy succeeds or not, but whether you make yourself vulnerable," Díaz replies. "And the women in the book keep making themselves vulnerable to intimacy. Part of why they're such interesting characters is that despite the dangers they're in, they're open to the possibility of intimacy in ways Yunior never is."Yes...and these women look like chumps, because all the men do is cheat on them! They're far less interesting characters for being merely acted upon, with no desires of their own (nor are they ever as funny as the men). We pretty much only see the women as exes, crying and screaming after they've been cheated on, or as new possibilities, cataloged in terms of their fuckworthiness.It's a frustration familiar to me as a female reader. Díaz writes so beautifully that I happily inhabit his characters: the boy from the Caribbean seeing snow for the first time; the teenager arguing with his dying brother, who wants to be buried in his car ("What, you a pharaoh now?"); even the cheater trying to get his angry girlfriend to relent—but "she Bartlebys me, says No, I'd rather not." I love his high-low range, his lyrical descriptions of place, his ear for the music of everyday talk. But the constant dismissal of women as sets of culo-and-titties slams a door in my face.Díaz says it's important to map a mind like Yunior's because "it's astonishing how little we understand male subjectivity." At which point my jaw discreetly drops: Is he calling this stuff under­ reported?! Yes, Díaz's voice is fresh, as is the Dominican/New Jersey working-class nerd-turned-academic perspective. But I've been reading about women through a lens of leering contempt forever. That men reduce women to body parts and to their sexual withholding/putting-out/performance is not a revelation. Recording that reductiveness without comment, exploration, or illumination does not a successful "feminist-aligned project" make.So I say, not to Díaz, but to This Is How You Lose Her: About my failure to engage productively with your maps of male subjectivity? It's not me, it's you.

Ruth Saunders isn't your average Tinseltown-bound college grad with a "funny-mean" wit and an English literature degree. The young TV writer in Jennifer Weiner's latest, The Next Best Thing (Atria Books), treks cross-country not with a gal pal or boyfriend but with the grandmother who raised her after a car accident killed her parents and shattered her face.In L.A., where "beauty was as common as the oranges that grew on the trees everyone had in their backyards," Ruth camouflages her scars with a coffee-colored fedora as she climbs the rungs and pitches a sitcom inspired by her life—and by The Golden Girls. Meanwhile, divinely dressed Grandma (in her Chanel and DVF and omnipresent Hermes scarf) learns "to speak Variety" as an in-demand extra.Ruth's career-minded, but writers'-room crushes cultivated over one-liners can't help but turn sexy. Weiner shows us Hollywood's glitter and grit, from people-watching at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pilot-season heartbreak, as Ruth learns how cutthroat it can be, on-screen and off.

Once a popular school couple, two well-to-do middle-aged Jamaicans square off in a restaurant: He, now a British-educated lawyer who's returned home with an Irish bride, seeks some kind of reconciliation; she greets him with the implacable hauteur of an Egyptian queen...then ends up helping him bury his mother and seeing to it that his foolish young Deidra doesn't purchase a mortifying wardrobe for life on the ­island. A roadside ­flower seller whose mother and step­father ran him off two years ago at age 11 dreams of the ­governor- general's wife rolling down the window of her Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and inviting him to live in her home. In 22 ­stories that range across the whole of island ­society, Jamaican author Lorna Goodison, who teaches writing at the University of Michigan, gives us a matchless ­mosaic ­portrait of a rapidly vanishing post­colonial time and place in By Love ­Possessed (Amistad)—a ­perfect ­complement to her evocative, widely ­admired ­memoir about her family's heritage, From Harvey River.The voices come vividly off the page, unerring in their Carib­bean ­cadence—especially those in thickest patois. A mother tired of her daughter's coddling of a wedding-shy baby-daddy says, "Me a one independent woman. Me no haffi put up with foolishness from man, as them bother me two time, I run them backside"; a striving wife working in New York City who's trying to placate her fed-up, wandering­-eye husband back home writes, "I'm just trying to make it so that you and me and the children can live a better life and stop having to box feeding outta hog mouth."Goodison keeps a tight focus in all her stories on the hopes and delusions that sustain rela­tionships as they warp and buckle ­under the contingencies of fallible choices and fateful events. In doing so, she taps deeply into universal experience and ­offers up these lives with brutal honesty and ­poignant humanism.

Toni Morrison is at an upstate New York residence talking about her new novel, Home (Knopf), which takes place in mid-twentieth-century America. "I was interested in the 1950s because we associate it with the postwar Doris Day decade, when it really wasn't like that. Forty thousand ­Americans died in the Korean War, which wasn't called a war—it was called a police action. It was the time of the ­McCarthy hearings and a lot of medical apartheid, the license of [eugenics practitioners] preying on black women, the syphilis trials on black men. The '50s were a highly violent race period. ­Emmett Till was murdered in 1955. There were a lot of ­moments like that. The seeds of the '60s and '70s were ­already being planted."At age 81, Morrison's voice retains its characteristic depth and clarity, qualities that combine to sound equally commanding and accommodating, rigorous and reassuring. Even though we met not face-to-face but rather via old-school landline after our finicky cell phones failed us, this pre­eminent Nobel Prize–winning writer has a formidable presence that imparts to the listener a shivery sense of her monumental intellect, breadth of experience, and spirited sense of justice.

We Recommend
At the heart of Home is Korean War veteran Frank Money, who is struggling to come to terms with his life: his post-traumatic stress disorder, his kinfolk, his dirt-poor speck of a Georgia hometown. Like Morrison's earliest novels, The ­Bluest Eye (1970) and Sula (1973), Home's slim spine ­belies a ­fertile narrative imbued with and ­embellished by Morrison's visionary scope and poetic ­majesty. These traits ­expand on her long exploration of the suffering and striving born of slavery and segregation that are unique to the history of blacks in ­America. Conjoined in all her stories and richly illumined are the ­culture, tradi­tions, talents, and ­triumphs of African-­Americans as well.Morrison, the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Human­ities emerita at Princeton University, says that in creating this novel's hero she was "trying to think of when a man would love a woman without the baggage. Who is the female ­figure that he would love selflessly? Not a ­mother, not a lover, not a wife—only a sister." The book's main arc follows Frank's journey to manhood through the actions he takes to save his younger sister, Cee, whom he had always sought to protect during their childhood, from a shady racist doctor.I mention to Morrison that I love how Frank cajoles, quarrels with, confesses to, and questions the third-person narrator. He does this at intervals throughout the book in italicized passages that serve as correctives to the ­narrator's account of events. This inventive literary device ­establishes an ongoing dialogue—a call and response—­between Frank's budding conscience as a man and the ­story's teller. "That was my great discovery!" Morrison exclaims. "I didn't want to take on the `I' persona, so he and I are in this relationship. He learns about what he does. He learns about himself. And he learns with the aid of community."A bookish child who grew up in working-class Lorain, Ohio—she cut her teeth on black folktales and later devoured Austen and Tolstoy—Morrison relishes conversing about the act of creating whole worlds on the page. As she puts it, "I only want to write clear. I like the space, the invisible ink"—what gets communicated between the lines, in those breathing gaps.But there's more to her method of writing than her time-honored longhand "scratch-and-cut." ­Before we hang up, she tells me how much she ­enjoyed ­doing research on the cotton plant for Home, about the fields of pink flowers that fall fast, and then the bolls that follow, and how the white cotton fluff blooms from these dark pods. The manifest author­ity in her voice transports, and I'm standing right there, seeing it.

When we leave home, our self-knowledge and life goals are often thrown into disarray. For dutiful, driven only-child ­Amina, the woman at the heart of Nell Freud­en­berger's densely beautiful ­novel The Newlyweds (Knopf), advancing the plan that seemed most favor­able to her family—bringing her parents out of Bangladesh to ­America after ­gaining citizenship here herself—is initially gratifying. Settling into suburban Rochester, New York, with her new American husband, George, the solid and seemingly sympathetic ­engineer she met on the Inter­net, Amina marvels at mailboxes, snow, and the local supermarket. She takes part-time ­service work and English classes and is ­kindly if somewhat stiffly ­embraced by her in-laws. But when ­Amina learns that George is not so eager to install her parents in their three-bedroom split-level—and also has a more complicated romantic history than he had let on—her shame is searing.By the time Amina returns to Bangladesh to fetch her parents, we don't know whether she will go back to George or pursue Nasir, her father's best friend's handsome, worldly son, for whom she finds she feels intense sexual desire. Even more stirring than this tension is Amina's growing understanding that ­moving forward often involves losing one's grip. Freudenberger, a deliciously precise and perceptive writer, loosely based Amina on a woman she met on an airplane, and when she describes Amina's recognition "that the permanent part of your own experience, the net that held it all together" is largely an illusion because we're all "many selves, dissolving into one another so quickly over time that the buildings and the trees and even the pavement turned out to have more substance than you," we can only be glad they struck up what must have been a helluva conversation.

Gabriella Mondini isn't your typical Venetian ­society lady: Her father made her his ­protégé in medicine and his collaborator in composing a grand compen­dium on healing. But after Dad ­departs for foreign lands in 1580, in search of more cures, the good ­doctors of Venice eventually make Mondini under­stand that, as a woman, she is no ­longer free to treat ­patients. So she flees the city a decade after her father and criss­crosses ­Europe looking for him—as well as ­for new entries to add to their volume, The Book of Madness and Cures.Prizewinning poet and artist Regina O'Melveny's debut novel of the same title from Little, Brown traces our spirited heroine's transit through the spooky German Schwarzwald, ­humanistic Hol­land, academic Edin­burgh, Reformation-torn France, and post-Inquisition Spain to Morocco. Her journey, with two loyal servants in tow, is filled with incident—brigandage, religious and gender prejudice, the ­necessity of disguise, tantalizing traces of her father's trail, even some hot, bodice-unlacing action—all conveyed with earthy and sensual brio, clearly well-researched evocations of time and place, and, not surprisingly, poetical description: On a ship to Morocco, Mondini beholds a vast pod of dolphins not merely leaping out of the sea but "sewing sky to water." If that image grabs you, you will love this adventure.

What possessed novelist and memoirist Kathryn Harrison to seize upon ­Grigory Rasputin, the peasant mystic who beguiled the doomed house of the last Tsar, as the catalyst of her new novel, ­Enchantments (Random House)? She traces his lure to "a particular childhood event":"I was in a car accident with my grand­father when I was five," Harrison ­recalls, speaking from her Brooklyn home. "I was standing outside the car. I'd ­gotten lacerated and there was a lot of blood pouring—it looked to me—out of my face. And by some weird coincidence my ­mother happened to be driving by, and she pulled over and sprang out of her car" to stop the bleeding.When Harrison read ­Robert Massie's blockbusting ­account of the end of the Romanov ­dynasty, Nicholas and Alexandra ("the first sort of ­legitimately adult book I'd read and understood"), at age 11, she was transfixed, she says, by the ­drama of Rasputin's apparent ability to stop the hemo­philiac bleeding of Alexis, the royal couple's son and intended successor.

We Recommend
Finally a few years ago Harrison came across further information: "One doesn't think of Rasputin as a family man," she notes drily about the grubby faith-healer from Siberia who showed up in the spiritist hothouse of St. Petersburg and was soon bestowing sexual healing on a whole string of society ladies. "I was intrigued that he had a wife and children—and even more interested to discover that he had brought his two daughters to Peters­burg." Upon learning that "his daughter had become a lion-­tamer and was billed all over Europe as the daughter of the Mad Monk, I just thought that was a ­completely seductive, delightful fact," Harrison ­concludes.She was hooked: Enchant­ments ­became a ­labor of love, a scrupulously ­researched ­retelling of the fiery end of ­Russia, the Land of the Firebird, through the eyes of ­Masha Rasputin, the 18-year-old girl who, in ­Harrison's yarn, is entrusted with the ­care of the interminably bleeding Tsarevitch Alyosha after the murder of her father.So we are treated to a hectic mélange of the fantastical and the fanatical—the lurid and bizarre demise of Rasputin; the exile and isolation of the Romanovs amid their ­fabled palace finery; the ­drunken, bloody-minded carryings-on of their Bolshevik captors—all recounted as the adolescent ­sexual heat between Masha and Alyosha begins to steam up the palace windows. Masha's story­telling becomes a kind of sacrament to the tsarevitch, who sees the looming end too clearly for his own good: "After I'd told Alyosha the story of the ­Virgin in the ­Silver Forest once or twice, it became something closer to a prayer than a distraction. Were I to omit a detail, ­Alyosha ­supplied it. If I changed anything inadvertently, he corrected me. It had to be the same each time, exactly the same."Harrison breaks up this claustrophobic milieu with some marvelous riffs: Tipping her hat, for example, to both the Rolling Stones and Mikhail Bulgakov's Soviet-era surrealist masterpiece, The Master and Margarita, she has the Devil himself and his cat, Behemoth—"black as a rook, tall as a man, and standing upright on his hind legs"—instigate a beer riot that wreaks fatal mayhem on the morning of Nicholas II's coronation.But most of all, Enchantments is about the irreducible mysteries of human motivation. Harrison, whose harrowing 1997 memoir, The Kiss, was about her relentless incestuous seduction by her long-­absent father, is drawn to our unknowability. She has begun a biography of Joan of Arc: "What's interesting about her is what's interesting about Rasputin. You can come at her from any number of vantages, and she still doesn't make sense. One doesn't want to be left saying, `Well, the angels told her what to do'—but it's kind of hard not to."

Ink is to art as water is to life for graphic novelist Craig Thompson, whose new opus, Habibi (Pantheon), his first in seven years, stretches across ­ancient Middle Eastern geographies, religions, mythologies, and migrations—the whole imaginative sweep of Arab and Christian foundational ­histories—to tell the story of Dodola, a runaway child bride, and Zam, the orphan she rescues in the slave market where they first meet.Thompson, whose previous graphic books are Blankets (published in nearly 20 languages), Good-bye, Chunky Rice, and Carnet de Voyage, again mesmer­izes from the first drop of ink, fashioning from it both a ­physical river and a river of time from which the narrative of these two youngsters ­surfaces. Light-skinned, 12-year-old Dodola and dark-skinned, three-year-old Zam (Dodola calls him Habibi, which means "darling") take refuge on an abandoned boat in a vast desert. For provisions, Dodola walks out to meet the passing caravans, where she barters her young body for ­baskets of food. To pass time, Dodola tells Zam the great ­stories of heaven and earth that her husband, a scribe, taught her when she was sold to him in ­marriage at age nine by her impoverished father.

We Recommend
Divided into nine lavishly drawn, tightly narrated sections that correspond to the creation myth of Arabic numbers and letters, Habibi lifts the bar of graphic storytelling to new heights, both by the intricate, dramatic density and breathtaking scholar­ship of Thompson's panels and by the sheer scale and decorative beauty of his flowing, roiling, protean style. Thompson is the Charles Dickens of the genre, able to capture all the scary, heartbreaking, brave, uplifting details of his characters' fates while orchestrating the big-picture machinations that connect them to the lives and times of his readers.At 672 mind-expanding pages, Habibi is a masterpiece that surely is one of a kind.

Erin Morgenstern is an artist and a fabulist, and, with her debut novel, The Night Circus (Double­day), set for a first printing of 175,000 and ­already optioned for film development by Summit Entertainment (the ­Twilight folks), she's sud­denly a fantastically ­successful ­author as well.Morgenstern's chosen late-nineteenth-century milieu is, as the ­title suggests, a nocturnal show that opens when a "dream­like" clock out­side a maze of striped tents declares nightfall, and the traveling ­Circus of Dreams is transformed into an ­arena of illusion for its ­bat­tling magi­cians. At age five, ­Celia Bowen ­arrived on the steps of her ­father's theater with her mother's suicide note pinned to her coat and a pocketful of psychokinetic powers. Once her natural talent is revealed, her father—the famed Prospero the Enchanter—pits her against a young illusionist named Marco. However, before Celia and Marco realize the not-so-happily-ever-­after terms of the challenge, they fall in love.

We Recommend
Circus is populated with fascinating figures—­Bailey, a humble farm boy; Poppet and Widget, the redheaded twins who befriend him; and Tsukiko, a tattooed contortionist who knows more than she lets on, to name a few—who are tangled in the web of the magicians' dangerous game, which imperils the circus' survival. Morgenstern's yarn is escapism at its finest. If the aroma of popcorn, caramel, and a burning bonfire doesn't leave you bewitched, then a whirlwind climb through the enchanting Cloud Maze or a stroll through the lush and charming Ice Garden will. Morgenstern's Circus is the stuff that dreams are made of, and nothing short of a wild ride.

After 13-year-old Felice Muir runs away from her Miami home in Diana Abu-Jaber's new novel, Birds of Paradise (Norton), her mother, Avis, retreats to her kitchen, where she creates elaborate pastries as part therapy, part offering to her absent daughter. Felice's father, Brian, buries himself in his lawyering and fantasizes about the young Cuban woman in the office next door, and her brother, Stanley, throws himself into the organic market he's opened in lieu of going to college. They all vacillate between willing themselves to forget Felice and constant wondering—why she left, where she is, if she's alive—until the approach of her eighteenth birthday and a storm named Katrina upsets their fragile holding patterns.Abu-Jaber (Arabian Jazz, Crescent) employs her descriptive talents in bringing Miami to steamy, pulsing life, but it is Birds of Paradise's neither predictable nor merely haphazard momentum and its rich cast of characters that make us feel we're in deliciously capable hands. Particularly well done is Felice herself—squatting in an abandoned mansion with fellow teens, passing days on the beach, developing a sweetly wholesome relationship with a shaven-headed fellow street kid named Emerson, and squandering long nights on the strip, where "rental cars ease down the street, girls sitting on top, legs dangling into sunroofs," and in the clubs with their "circular metal staircases and semi-private nooks for snorting and smoking and screwing."Felice's convincing mixture of toughness and vulnerability, of adolescent stubbornness and deep moral conflict, of extraordinary beauty and punishing world-weariness makes you root for the runaway despite all the pain she's caused. She's the bird of paradise that makes this novel soar.

I love you,' Ross says.... `You don't even know me,' " laughs Heather, the alienated, at-sea high schooler he's practicing sex with, in the first lines of Elissa Schappell's ­story collection, Blueprints for Building Better Girls ­(Simon & Schuster). The sadness is that no one else knows her, ­either—including ­herself. None of the ­youths in these variously linked stories convey any sense of self-illumination, and plenty suffer from what one coed laughingly calls a "battered party girl syndrome" of blackouts, black eyes, and worse.A little older, sadder, and wiser, some of them soon come face to face with the discontents of young-family life—or, worse, with ­infertility. ("In truth, we had sex more than pandas, but less than dogs.") All the while, Schappell's sardonic, not-afraid-to-show-ugly voice quietly carries us along, linking sex and dread—not in a Scary Movie way but rather in a mode of hard-lesson suburban nihilism.

We Recommend
Heather, now a middle-aged mom watching her teenaged son skitter away from her, resurfaces in a final harrowing story, but it's the lost college kids, stumbling around clueless and careless just weeks before their graduation, that stay in the mind: an already vanishing breed in this Brave New World of punishing college-loan debt and moving back in with Ma and Pa to polish the ol' résumé and pray for a job.

The God-fearing hard-luck characters who populate Donald Ray Pollock's ­debut novel, The Devil All the Time (Doubleday), move through the southern outlands of Ohio and the isolated hollows of West Virginia like figures in a collective nightmare of ­poverty, addiction, superstition, and crime. Sprung from their rough histories, they mostly prey on their own troubled, downtrodden kin and kind.Pollock—who spent three decades working at an Ohio paper mill before his 2008 story collection, Knockemstiff (the name of his real-life hometown), garnered widespread acclaim—doesn't get a word wrong in this super-edgy American ­Gothic ­stunner. Here are World War II combat vet Willard Russell and his young son, Arvin, at an outdoor shrine the father has constructed in a fruitless attempt to keep his beautiful young wife from dying of cancer: "They knelt down and Arvin glanced over at his ­father's skinned knuckles...the sounds traveling up the hill from the holler were especially clear that night...the wild hoots and jeers of the drunks reminded the boy of the hunter lying bloody in the mud. His father had taught that man a lesson he would never forget. He closed his eyes and began to pray."

We Recommend
The flawless cadence of Pollock's gorgeous ­shadow-and-light prose plays against the heinous acts of his sorrowful and sometimes just sorry characters, such as lawless preacher Roy and his wheelchair-bound, guitar-playing, pedophile sidekick, Theodore, who stay one scam ahead of the police; and Carl and Sandy, a husband and wife who pick up male hitchhikers and photograph them ­before dispatching them to a (no doubt) better world.As Arvin grows up—The Devil All the Time's narrative arcs from the end of World War II to the late 1960s—life's twists and turns ­provide him with a measure of salvation from his own past, and from the people whose soul-damaged lives Pollock has set down so indelibly on the blood-red altar of his incendiary imagination.

In Bonnie Jo Campbell's beguiling coming-of-age tale Once Upon a River (Norton), Margo Crane, a free spirit and precocious sharpshooter, has spent her formative years daydreaming, fishing, and swimming on a river in rural Michigan. But at 16, Crane is engulfed in a chaos of family loss, betrayal, and vengeance, so she heads upstream in her teak boat with only a .22 Marlin, a box of ammo, and a biography of her idol, Annie Oakley, to track down her absent mother.Like her admired 2009 story collection, American Salvage, Campbell's novel is peopled with down-home, gritty, rough-around-the edges characters, among whom Margo seeks comfort and shelter before realizing that "she wanted something more, that she had something worth protecting."Campbell bluntly sets out Margo's tragic choices, from facing an abuser ("Saying no would be like releasing a bullet from the chamber—there would be no way to take it back") to accepting a life-saving liaison ("Margo gripped his arms, and she saw how he formed a house around her, how his big body became a dwelling in which she could live and be safe").With all the fixings of a Johnny Cash song—love, loss, redemption—Campbell captures these Michiganders and their earthy, brutal paradise in tales rich with insight and well worth the trip.

If poems are "imaginary gardens with real toads in them," as poet Marianne Moore put it, novels are imaginary jungles, teeming with life and thick with incident. Certainly that's true of State of Wonder (Harper), an outlandishly entertaining fiction from Ann Patchett, who in works such as the best-seller Bel Canto has taken the pleasures of unlikelihood about as far as you'd think they could go.And yet State of Wonder goes further. When a colleague dies in the Amazon rain forest while checking the progress of fieldwork being conducted among the (fictional) Lakashi people there, Marina Singh heads to Brazil to investigate. Before you can say Heart of Darkness, this most unadventurous of adventure heroines—a Minnesota doctor who gave up obstetrics for the calmer life of a pharmacology lab—is knee-deep in a metaphysical journey to the depths of her soul. Her soul turns out to be rather shallow: She's dull, except when she makes shocking, reckless decisions. Then she's immediately dull again.

We Recommend
No matter: Her decisions drive a brilliantly constructed plot. Even the few sidetracks (who wants to read repeatedly about a character's recurring dreams?) turn out to wind the story toward its gaspworthy conclusion. In contrast to Marina herself, everything she encounters is absurdly fascinating, or absurd and fascinating: the louche expatriate life in Manaus, Brazil; the Lakashi, whose women remain fertile until death; and especially Annick Swenson, the obsessed researcher who has cracked the fertility secret and a few heads besides. Did I mention the anaconda, the cannibals, and the C-sections performed with shoehorns?Not that there aren't quieter pleasures here too. Patchett's prose is always astute: A golden retriever has "limp chamois" ears; and "hope is like walking around with a fishhook in your mouth and somebody just keeps pulling it and pulling it." But State of Wonder isn't trying to wring its meaning from the sponge of realism; it's about the rapture of being overwhelmed, which is why its scientific jabber and one-note personalities don't detract much. They may be "real toads," but Patchett's jungle is mysterious and beautiful.

"Not to go to you is to precipitate the dark, and yet I hesitate. It is not that I do not crave the light—rather it is the certainty of the eventual dark." Such are the doomful conclusions of a woman in Edna O'Brien's new story collection, Saints and Sinners (Back Bay), who has embarked on an affair with a prosperous, egotistical architect and keeps returning to the "concrete wall against which you threw me cruciform-wise to press your ebullient suit." That is her Rosebud, her sacred spot, and it's all she has to go on, however far it will take her.In "Manhattan Medley," O'Brien's deep and wise knowledge of this woman seems absolute, and these stories—whether epic lives or family histories in 30 or so pages ("Shovel Kings," "Old Wounds") or glowing embers of single afternoons or evenings in 15 ("Green Georgette," "Madame Cassandra")—showcase the author's genius at capturing spectral, holographic images of human consciousness and its compulsions.

We Recommend
Beyond that mastery lies a capacity to stare unblinkingly at tragedy. In "Plunder," set in an unnamed modern rural war zone, a girl's life is overtaken by an anonymous band of thuggish irregulars: "Their shouts, their weight, their tongues, their slobber, the way they bore through me, wanting to get up into my head, to the God particle.... They couldn't get to it." What a fearless storyteller is O'Brien.

Shakespeare's comedy A Midsummer Night's Dream serves as the ripe template for Chris Adrian's third novel, The Great Night ­(Farrar, Straus and Giroux), a raucous, ribald tale set in contemporary San Francisco that begins: "One night in the middle of June, three brokenhearted people walked into Buena Vista Park at nearly the same time, just after dark. One came from the north, out of the Haight, another climbed up out of the Castro from the east, and the last came from the west, out of the Sunset and Cole Valley: This one was already going in the wrong direction, and shortly all three of them would be lost."From there, the story blooms like a psychedelic nightshade plant into the magical, terrible underground kingdom where the humans—Henry, Will, and Molly, plus five others, named Huff, Bob, Mary, Princess, and Hogg—become pawns caught up in the dark, twisted deeds of vengeful Queen Titania, unfaithful King Oberon, and mischievous Puck. In the wake of her failed marriage and the death of her adopted son, Titania casts a spell that releases all manner of chaos upon both the upper and the lower realms, including having the homeless Huff (bent on taking down San Francisco's mayor) stage in the park a musical-theater version of the schlocky 1973 sci-fi movie Soylent Green.

We Recommend
Events turn ever wackier, ever more sinister and seductive, as Adrian's narrative spins outward from its Bard-based core to its near-hard-core-bawdy apogee, in which both the ­mortals and the underworld fairies engage in phantasmagorically depicted sexual, familial, ancient, childhood, professional, and political ­debaucheries-cum-memories-cum-dreams-run-amok.Adrian, currently a fellow in pediatric oncology at the ­University of California, San Francisco, and a Harvard ­Divinity School ­student, covered smaller, more controlled canvases in his previous works—Gob's Grief and The Children's Hospital, and the story collection A Better Angel. The Great Night—by turns brilliant, cruel, tenderhearted, visionary, poetic, and profane—is Adrian's ambitious attempt to fetch from his own imagination what Shakespeare referred to as "jewels from the deep."

Cover: Harper CollinsA bright, hot, glorious Memorial Day weekend's passed and no doubt many of you have already developed a taste for lazy beach-day reads—we have!  So below, we inaugurate our summer reading list—where we review the season's most engrossing releases—with Louisa Young's unflinching but artful wartime romance.My Dear, I Wanted To Tell You (Harper Collins) borrows its title from the first line of the form letter wounded British soldiers in World War I sent to their loved ones waiting on the home front. In her first adult novel, British author Louisa Young (who co-wrote the British young adult series Lionboy with her daughter) draws on years of research into her family's involvement in pioneering medical treatments for disfigured soldiers during the Great War. Her fascination with the mental and physical traumas that plague both the men who return from war and the families that receive them lends itself to a work of fiction set against a startlingly rich and detailed view of life in and out of the trenches.

We Recommend
The novel follows the interconnected stories of two couples: Riley Purefoy and Natalie Waveny, and Peter and Julia Locke. Through first-person narratives, Young conjures comparison to Tolstoy's War and Peace, if in a simpler and more plainspoken way, as she moves fluidly from the battlefield to the stately mansions of bohemian artists and modest homes of London's working class neighborhoods. The well-worn voices of her protagonists are where Young's expertise and fine sense of realism shine. She reminds us that the true heartbeat of the story lies not in the frenetic scenes of battle, or even within the soldiers themselves, but in vivid and unexpected reminders that some of the most harrowing experiences of war can take place in the effort to return home.Louisa Young's My Dear, I Wanted to Tell is on sale today.

It is difficult, maybe even impossible, when reading a hotly anticipated first novel by a cele­brated 25-year-old writer, not to think about her age, to subconsciously search for evidence of the callowness, inexperience, and showiness that would naturally be expected, and forgiven, in the work of a writer so young.Téa Obreht was born in Yugo­slavia in 1985; her family left in 1992 as civil war threatened, and she came to the United States five years ­later after living in Cyprus and Egypt. Hers is the youngest name on The New Yorker's ­recent list of the 20 best American writers under 40 years old. I opened The Tiger's Wife (Random House) prepared to empathize with Obreht's youth and to temper my reaction if the novel didn't, as a whole, stand up to the expectations and hype. Because, really, how could it?

We Recommend
But the book does, and then some. Obreht is a natural literary descendant of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Gabriel García Márquez. She has assimilated and alchemized the techniques of folkloric storytelling and magical realism with a fresh contemporary sensibility, along with her own ethnic identity and life experiences. After a few pages, I forgot her age entirely ­except to marvel at the precocity of her work's vast intelligence, at the beauty of her descrip­tive prose, at her authoritative voice, and at her controlled mastery of a complex narrative.The Tiger's Wife is the story of Natalia, a young doctor in an unnamed war-stricken ­Balkan country. Her beloved grandfather, also a doctor, has recently died under mysterious circum­stances in a village no one has ever heard of. Natalia is on a medical humanitarian-aid ­mission to an orphanage on the other side of the war-created border when she learns that this mysterious village is right nearby. Immediately, she goes there to retrieve her grand­father's possessions, which leads her to investigate his life and death, his childhood in a village called Galina, and the two intertwining stories he had told her about his past: that of the tiger's wife and that of the Deathless Man.During World War II, he had told her, a tiger escaped from a bombed-out city zoo and wandered the countryside, finally taking refuge in the hills above Galina. The deaf-mute and domestically battered wife of the town's butcher befriended, fed, and protected the tiger, causing many in the village to suspect her, superstitiously, of being his lover. Natalia's grandfather, a small boy at the time, was witness to the village's fear and ongoing persecution of both beast and woman. Later, as a doctor, he repeatedly encountered an eternally youthful, Lazarus-like vagabond who claimed to be "deathless" and proved it on a bet with her grandfather, who had staked his precious copy of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. Over time, he ­managed to ferret out the Deathless Man's connection to the tiger's wife.Retracing the origins and intersection of these goings-on, Natalia visits Galina to search for the Deathless Man and make sense of her grandfather's story. What she finds out yields a cracking, complex, gorgeously wrought saga that resonates as a meditation on life, love, wartime and medicine, a country internally torn by ongoing strife, and our responsibility to the stories we inherit from our grandparents—literal and otherwise.Obreht writes out of a clear sense of respect for her own literary forefathers; The Tiger's Wife is an original and wonderful novel, but it also reads like a grateful, delighted homage to writers whom the author has cited as shaping and inspiring her own work. It makes for a thrilling beginning to what will certainly be a great literary career.

When the Soviet Union fell, the country went through a sort of nervous breakdown.... We didn't realize that nothing could change until people find themselves." Thus Natasha, a child of privilege haunted by her father's prominence in the nuclear-weapons industry, describes her generation's fate: mainly, being lost. She's one of a handful of savvy young Russians whom British Russophile Susan Richards has followed with love, hope, and increasingly urgent concern for the better part of two ­decades—a chaotic era she nails with the deft circuitousness and exactitude of a Robert Altman movie in Lost and Found in Russia (Other Press).Besides Natasha and her brainy and loyal beau, Igor, Richards intro­duces us to Anna, a fearless journalist; bootstrapping capitalists Misha and Tatiana; Ira and Sasha, who become stylish Moscow cineasts but are ­ruined in Russia's 1998 economic meltdown; and Vera, a defense-industry physicist who joins the millennial cult of a cheesy Second Coming candidate named Vissarion and runs off to Siberia. Richards revisits and reconnects with all these poster children of Slavic moder­nity (even Vera), and we come to follow their every peripatetic move and reversal of fortune with a zeal that comes of ­realizing: This is what it feels like when Things Fall Apart.

We Recommend
But Richards' real genius is how she slips "through a crack in the wardrobe" to Russia's far reaches with alarming abandon—hitching a ride on the Volga luxury cruise ship of a wheeler-dealer she's never met; flying without proper ­papers into an Uzbek mining town that's been ­virtually overwhelmed by mass sightings of UFOs and aliens; ­adventuring by boat and rust-bucket plane into a prospering colony of Old Believers led by a Dostoev­skian elder named Philimon (think Tea Partiers, if they'd ­started their push-back against "the encroach­ing power of the modernizing, power-hungry state" in the 1600s and ­survived even Stalinism). It's travel as jaw-dropping performance.

Writer, performer, and comic Steve Martin's third novel, An ­Object of Beauty (Grand Central), takes us deep inside the busy, comely, amoral New York City art world via its gorgeous and ultimately ­deceptive surfaces. We follow young Atlanta transplant Lacey ­Yeager for 15 years through her—and the art market's—1990s rise and subsequent fall. She's a flirtatious firebrand who seems hardwired to move up and move on by outwitting her ­professional peers, clients, and higher-ups, not to mention her lovers, family, and friends. She's the most charmingly rendered female schemer since Truman Capote's Holly Golightly, updated and recalibrated for our boom-to-bust economic times.Lacey's friend and onetime lover, Daniel—a stand-up guy who writes reviews for ARTnews—narrates her increasingly secretive global fine-art hijinks. Here's how we meet Lacey, circa 1993, through Daniel's still-besotted eyes: "Sometimes she showed up at a Manhattan café with a new boyfriend who was required to tolerate my unexplained presence, and when she excused herself to the restroom, the ­boyfriend and I would struggle for conversation while he tried to discover if I was an ex-lover, as he soon would be."

We Recommend
Through cunning and pure smarts, Lacey acquires an on-the-job education in art history. A certain Picasso painting she comes across is "deep and serious," while a Warhol she sees is "radiant and buoyant." She quickly begins to arrange buys and sells; as her ­reputation grows, so does her private collection, which comes to range from a painting by 1920s illustrator Maxfield Parrish, for which her now 92-year-old grandmother served as the model, to an early Warhol. Mystery and intrigue accompany these works and—seemingly—all the artwork that changes hands in the lively netherworlds of creation and commerce.Martin's previous novels, Shopgirl (a hit) and The Pleasure of My Company (a miss), summoned his gift for deft characterizations; add larcenous wit and insider knowledge of the Manhattan art scene, and—behold—An ­Object of Beauty becomes a bodacious, brainy, bountiful read and a bracing cautionary tale.

Photo: Random HouseSalman Rushdie's lastest must-read, Luka and the Fire of Life is out this month from Random House. Rushdie says that he penned his novel for his 13-year-old son Milan, in the same mythological spirit that he wrote Haroun and The Seas of Stories over twenty years ago for his older son Zafar. The work, Rushdie's second children's book, is thematically consistent with all of his other books in which he explores the struggle of the individual story teller within our world of collective myth making, but is written in a language that is far more accessible to a younger audience.

We Recommend
Like Haroun and The Sea of Stories, Luka and the Fire of Life takes teenagers back into a fantastical realm where they follow the protagonist on an epic hero-quest where he must vanquish gods and goddesses while trying to rekindle the fire of life to save his dying father. Rushdie will be on hand tonight at the 92nd street Y to discuss his book and take questions.  It starts at 8, so get your tickets now!

Photo: CounterpointIn her outstanding new collection of short stories, Marry or Burn, Valerie Trueblood uses the threads of familiar topics—love, marriage, separation, general angst—to spin affecting, utterly unexpected yarns. There are first dates, broken hearts, unlooked-for affairs, and of course weddings (brides and grooms figure prominently in five of the 12 stories)—but Trueblood has completely rewritten the script for each of these everyday events.

People who cheat on their spouses or lose their first loves or their firstborn share these truths with their children—not in dramatic confessionals, but in the manner of parents passing along family history. A married woman finds herself fantasizing about her friend's husband—a charismatic, generous man who's dying from lymphoma. A disastrous affair between a teenager and her now-institutionalized history teacher's related to us from the perspective of the girl's aunt. A divorced doctor, while recovering from the recent death of his tempestuous lover, accidentally catches his ex-wife's boyfriend with another woman.As in life, even minor characters in these stories carry their own crucial emotional baggage. Trueblood, a master of pacing who is in her sixties, understands the intrinsic muddle of relationships and the essential imperfection of love—but she also respects our cultural hope for romantic happiness. While ties are brutally severed and lovers die early, her characters continue to marry and move on, like this alcoholic widow trying desperately to keep things together at her daughter's wedding: "Her eyes, in which her daughter has put soothing drops, blaze the blue of her dress, her feet clench in the new shoes, she vows, as at her own wedding, eternal beginning."Marry or Burn will be released through Counterpoint Books on November 9.

"Hanfeng had returned from the States a month earlier. He had told his former colleagues in San Francisco about his intention to settle down in China, and they had joked about moving with him and becoming the forty-niners of the new gold rush. He went along with the joke, making up ambitious business plans that he knew he would not carry out."Yiyun Li's delectable new collection, Gold Boy,Emerald Girl (Random House), brings us nine subtle and assured stories. As in her ­previous works, A ­Thousand Years of Good Prayers and The Vagrants, Li—who studied ­medicine ­before she began to write­—finds the pulse points in the lives of her ­Chinese and Chinese-­American characters and renders her findings with empathy and ­exactitude.

We Recommend
In the lead-off tale, the near-novella-length "Kindness," a never-married math teacher living near ­Beijing reminisces about her service in the ­People's Liberation Army two ­decades earlier, forging connec­tions to her childhood and to the present, where, she admits, "I have no hobby that makes me leave my flat during my spare time. I do not own a television set, but I have a roomful of books at least half a cen­tury older than I." Books, and the stories they hold, are "more real than our own, because, after all, we, the ­inadequate ­makers of our own lives, [are] no match for the masters who had written those tales for us." Such passages reveal Li's striking ability to move from her characters' mundane routines to the soaring truths that bind them all to the ­mysterious, on­going exigencies of life and death."He was raised by his mother alone," the title story begins, "as she was by her father." And thereby hangs the frame for the bright-dark tale of Siyu and ­Hanfeng, who are set up on a date by Hanfeng's mother, a ­retired zoology professor who missed "not the ­students...but the white skulls of mammals and birds on her office shelves...and the fact that she could mask her ­indifference to the human species with her devotion to animals."With serpentine beauty, Li's stories wind around the wreckage of multiple marriages, lonely only children, and old men ­wedding women 30 years younger than them. From these seminal situations, Li's ­characters, and perhaps her ­readers, emerge a bit ­sadder—and that much wiser.

Gary Shteyngart's third novel, Super Sad True Love Story (Random House), had to be a total blast to write. It's an homage to science fiction, George Orwell's 1984 in particular, with a satirical postmodern overlay of authorial wish fulfillment.In a world much like ours, only worse—New York City is a police state overrun with ­national guardsmen from the provinces, the dollar is ­"yuan-pegged," everyone has melded with his or her handheld media device (called äppäräts), books are considered smelly artifacts, and people are ashamed to be caught reading—Lenny Abramov, a balding, doughy, nerdy, book-loving 39-year-old son of Russian Jewish immigrants, falls in love with Eunice Park, the beautiful, tiny, cynical but sweet, shopping-obsessed 24-year-old daughter of Korean immigrants. Amazingly—­because in spite of their differences they're kindred spirits—she loves him back.

We Recommend
As the world around Lenny falls violently apart, he's buoyed and distracted by his tender passion for Eunice, who calls him "tuna" and "jerkface." He tries, and fails, to interest her in literature. In two of the novel's best set pieces, they meet each other's families. And they both, in their ways, try to make the world a better place.The text consists of Lenny's diary entries and Eunice's e-mails to various friends and family. They both write with endearing, sometimes clumsy earnestness, and their intertwining narratives, for all the book's cheeky darkness, pose a superserious question: Can love and language save the world?

Author of four previous novels that garnered numerous prestigious literary awards, Mona Simpson has always had a thing for families. This creative fetish long preceded her maternal life (she has a 16-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter), producing such literary gems as Anywhere But Here and The Lost Father. In her fifth novel, My Hollywood (Knopf), following a 10-year labor, Simpson takes readers inside the ever verging yet never quite merged worlds of thirty-something new parents Claire and Paul, and Lola, the 52-year-old Filipina nanny whom Claire hires to look after their newborn, William. After a spate of unsatisfactory agency interviews, Claire discovers Lola sitting on a bench and hires her on the spot without references.Speaking by phone from her home in Santa Monica, California, Simpson says she's nonplussed by the number of years it took to write this big, beautifully wrought novel. "It didn't feel like a long time. I enjoyed it. And I know I received much more from my children [during this time] than they took away," she adds. "Me and my slowness are my own."While the marriage of Claire, a musician, and Paul, a workaholic TV-comedy writer, slowly pulls apart, Lola keeps their household—as well as her own home back in the Philippines—intact. Their twin narratives are revealed in alternating chapters. A married mother of five who regularly sends money to her husband, Lola is polished, polite, and prepossessing. "My first day," Lola relates, "I found my employer crying by the heating grate. She was trying to breast-feed and she had very little milk. Maybe she is too old, I thought. My uncle in Visayas keeps cows and after four, five years, they will not anymore milk. My employer married late. Accomplished does not matter so much for a woman. Unless you are a movie star. I told her, It is okay, you cry. But when your tears dry, you will see, your baby he is very healthy."

We Recommend
As for the modern-day setup of her novel, which revolves around two working moms from vastly different countries and circumstances, Simpson refers back to the political ferment of the 1960s and 1970s. "It was just a time of massive cultural change that the world hasn't caught up with, of huge social shifts that still have to be put in place." That reality runs all through this intimate, ironic tale, in which Lola's nanny allies, and adversaries, all of differing nationalities, become a brilliant Greek chorus reflecting and refracting Lola and Claire's interdependence and their divide.While solidly middle-class Claire is petrified to own a house (she and Paul rent), Lola is the proud owner of one in her home country. By the end of the novel, she has wired almost a million dollars home to her family. So ultimately, is My Hollywood Lola's or Claire's? Simpson demurs. The title "is a little crooked," she says. "I wanted the book to surprise me, and it did."

Her keen observations on the manners and mores of insular communities have earned Allegra Goodman (Intuition, Kaaterskill Falls) comparisons to two of her favorites, George Eliot and Jane Austen. Her new novel, The Cookbook Collector (Dial), set in the boom-and-bust years from 1999 to 2002, may remind readers more of Charles Dickens (another on her list) and his fin de siècle masterpiece, A Tale of Two Cities. In Goodman's variation, Emily is the 28-year-old CEO of Veritech, a Silicon Valley start-up, and her little sister, Jess, as charmingly unkempt as Emily is stylishly buttoned up, is a philosophy grad student at Berkeley. Their mother died when they were young, and both are now searching for connection to something bigger than themselves. Emily, like so many, becomes a paper millionaire after her company's IPO. She maintains a long-distance relationship with a technology entrepreneur in Boston. Jess, an environmental activist, works at an antiquarian bookstore run by George, who made a mint off Microsoft and fantasizes about romancing Jess in his Maybeck mansion.The cookbooks of the title refer to a trove of rare culinary guides that George and Jess are trying to obtain, which becomes a metaphor for longing, substitution, and thwarted satisfaction. Goodman is especially admired for evoking smart and subtly nuanced characters, and Emily and Jess are so emotionally authentic that I almost tried to Google them. She also perfectly captures what it felt like to be an optimistic, idealistic twentysomething during one of the most optimistic, idealistic periods in American history—when anyone who didn't risk everything felt like they were missing out on the main chance. Goodman writes that "ultimately Veritech's true product had nothing to do with data storage. What Veritech offered the public was its stupendous expectations." Unlike many of the companies of the First Digital Age, The Cookbook Collector is enormously satisfying and well worth the investment.

You know that moment when the ingenue in the horror movie heads downstairs to check the radiator, and you're screaming, dumbfounded, at the screen? That's the sort of protective rage you feel for Daley Amory, the narrator of Lily King's novel Father of the Rain (Atlantic Monthly Press), when she blows off a prestigious job in academia to return, at 29, to her hometown to help save her brutish, alcoholic cad of a dad from destroying himself. Even as you curse her naïveté, you know it couldn't have happened any other way.At the start of King's haunting, incisive story, which spans three decades, Daley is 11 and her mother is about to leave her father, a Waspy cutup full of country-club charm and devoid of compassion. He immediately remarries the mother of one of Daley's classmates. "Somehow he has ­hidden vast swaths of his personality from people who do not live with him," Daley realizes.On a family vacation with her father and new step-family, Daley glimpses the cruelty she's about to endure for years and years—and yet: "Even if it's at my own expense, I like making my father laugh. He has a lot of pretend and halfhearted laughs, but his real one makes a clicking sound in the back of his throat that I love to hear." She will continue to chase that laugh like a drug addict seeks to equal the first high; she'll never stop trying, but it will never feel the same, and the cost to her well-being will only continue to grow.

We Recommend
King is brilliant when writing from the eyes of a tween, all self-conscious curiosity but bright and hopeful as a starry sky. And as Daley grows up and learns how to trust and to love in spite of herself, King cuts a fine, fluid line to the melancholy truth: Even when we're grown and on our own— wives, mothers, CEOs—we still long to be someone's daughter. The dream of an absent ideal ­father is like a thick, soft blanket; find one to ­burrow under, and enjoy.

In her debut story collection, Death Is Not an Option (Norton), Pushcart Prize winner Suzanne Rivecca offers up seven bold narratives about the struggles we go through to ID other people, and in turn, ourselves. Rivecca's refreshing tales, laced with biting humor and '90s pop-culture references, cohere around the ideas of deception—public and personal— and, notably, lapsed Catholicism. (The author has fallen away herself, so is it any surprise that guilt is a recurring theme?)Rivecca's vulnerable and at times hilarious female protagonists have understandably provoked comparisons of her work to that of Mary Gaitskill. In "Very Special Victims," Kath, who is molested by her uncle when she is a young girl, must deal with the question of blame (read: guilt) and, later, learn how to explain to the men she dates what happened. The memoirist in "Look Ma, I'm Breathing," whose book revolves around her loss of faith, must defend her work in court against a pervy landlord. A gradeschool teacher takes it upon herself in "None of the Above" to investigate the scratches and scrapes she finds on one of her student's arms: His parents deny any accusations of abuse, and the boy claims that the wounds came from the family's pet tiger, which sleeps in his bed. (The ending's an absolute doozy.) And the title story, told by Emma, who stoically endures her parochial school's sappy graduation rituals, reads so believably that it could easily be nonfiction, thanks to lines that make us feel as if we sat next to her at the same school assembly: "[Amber Golin] ruined that song for me forever, not to mention she completely missed the point—it's called `Losing My Religion,' not `Celebrating My Patriarchal Religion with a Cheesy Streamer Dance Featuring My Huge Camel Toe.' "

Marcy Dermansky does proud the long, often sketchy, sometimes illustrious tradition of transgressive fiction with Bad Marie (Harper Perennial), her follow-up novel to her admired 2005 debut, Twins. As the story begins, the titular Marie has just finished a six-year prison stint for being an accessory to murder and bank robbery—a deadly misdeed coauthored by her boyfriend, who then killed himself in jail.But Dermansky is not interested in pursuing any kind of poor-Marie variation on what happens next. Her Marie is no cry-baby Anna Karenina fated to a star-crossed love for which she pays with her life. This big-bosomed 30-year-old ex-con makes a beeline for the doorstep of her childhood best friend, good-girl Ellen and her pristine New York City home. There, she is hired as the nanny for Caitlin, the toddler daughter of Ellen and her French novelist husband, Benoît.

We Recommend
Before long, Marie—who likes "a little whiskey, a little chocolate... watching bad television...afternoon naps," and especially taking bubble baths with her young charge—is discovered by the couple passed out in their tub. Her frank nakedness registers as a mais oui! in the hyper-Gallic Benoît's busy imagination, and they embark on an affair that takes them far, far away, with Caitlin, to naughty Paris and beyond.Allowing us a kind of all-access pass to the workings of Marie's feverish psyche, Dermansky writes, "Marie did not want Benoît because he belonged to Ellen. She wanted him because of the baguette sandwiches. She wanted him because of the sex in the afternoon." How can one not admire such a perfectly drawn mini portrait of perfidy?

Imagine all this crammed into a 225-page novel: a plot that hinges on massage and ESP; four separate story lines from different eras, all of which involve love affairs, most of them doomed; run-on sentences and sentence fragments; and no quotation marks to indicate dialogue. Add a lyrical, haunting tone (overused adjectives for books that sound pretty but don't add up to much). Top it off with a damaged, mysterious, sexy Iraq War vet and a cameo by a saxophone-playing angel. Now imagine that despite this grocery list of stylistic clichés and literary buzzkills, the novel is unpretentious, moving, intelligent, and fresh.Jane Mendelsohn's first novel, I Was Amelia Earhart, was another lyrical, haunting story that got away with everything most writers can't. In  American Music (Knopf), her third book, Mendelsohn has created characters who are so deeply sympathetic, so believably flawed and interesting, that the novelistic no-nos feel organically necessary to the story.At the V.A. hospital where he's convalescing from a spinal-cord injury, Milo's therapeutic masseuse is Honor, a 21-year-old former dancer whose touch unleashes stories that are projected onto the walls of their minds simultaneously: the love triangle of Joe, a sax player, his wife, Pearl, and her beautiful cousin, Vivian, in 1936; the tale of Iris, the young wife of an embattled lawyer who steals the life's work of a mysterious female photographer in 1969; and that of Parvin, an ancient Turkish concubine who falls in love with the eunuch who guards her and is set free by a selfless alchemist's skills. Each story is suspenseful and compelling, and equally so are the questions of how these disparate narratives will intersect and why they're being evoked by Honor's hands on Milo's body.

We Recommend
The revelatory conclusion is richly satisfying. So is Mendelsohn's exploration of the cymbal—the shimmering, reverberating metal disc that alchemically graces and drives the greatest American music—as a symbol of love. American Music is an inventive, passionate, pithy novel whose major theme is love itself and whose minor theme, music, is an emotional, meaningful counterpoint. Like Count Basie and His Orchestra, this book swings.

Novelist and journalist Jennifer Egan has the cool blond looks of a classic Alfred Hitchcock heroine. Think Grace Kelly in Rear Window or Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest. Like those characters, whose crisp, feminine elegance housed formidably imaginative, unabashedly risk-taking personas, the statuesque Egan is a boldly intellectual writer who is not afraid to apply her equally powerful intuitive skills to her ambitious projects. The New York Times Magazine contributing writer has published three acclaimed novels—The Keep, Look at Me, and The Invisible Circus—and one collection, Emerald City and Other Stories. Just out is her fourth novel, A Visit From the Goon Squad (Knopf), and while it's a time-trekking, tech-freakin' doozie, the characters' lives and fates claim the story first and foremost, and we are pulled right in. Sitting in a window seat in a bright splash of sunshine at Olea, a Mediterranean bistro in the Brooklyn neighborhood where she lives with her two sons and husband, David Herskovits, the director of the avante-garde Target Margin Theater, Egan says she wanted to "write a novel about time" and was influenced by such disparate sources as James Salter's book Light Years and the strong episodic character turns on HBO's long-running hit show The Sopranos. But it was Marcel Proust's massive, multivolume In Search of Lost Time, which she had tried to finish but bolted from in her twenties, that "made a huge impression" on Egan when she returned more recently to the masterpiece. There, she found the topics of time and its corollary—change—that would become the dynamic engine driving A Visit From the Goon Squad.

We Recommend
 The book is brilliantly structured, with storylike chapters that revolve around aging music mogul Bennie Salazar, his skittish assistant, Sasha, and a mosh pit of major and minor oddballs whose lives intersect, bisect, and disconnect in 1970s San Francisco and at scattered times between then and the near future in New York City, rural Africa, and Naples, Italy. When I ask Egan to describe how she wrote the book, her answer is immediate and emphatic: "So much of it was written in the shower! I would stand in the water and all these connections would start happening. Things I had wanted to make happen but didn't make sense in the whole began to connect. It was such an organic feeling, and I just had to pay attention. All in the shower!" Still, adds Egan, "The book is a little mysterious to me." She homes in on Goon Squad's penultimate chapter, "Great Rock and Roll Pauses," which she wrote PowerPoint-slide style. For Egan, a "handwriter," this exercise was completely counterintuitive. "That chapter, and the whole book really, felt like it was different [from my previous books], and it just kept asking me to be interested. What ended up not working were the narrative pieces that were master-plan based. Ultimately, I didn't care, because the level of obsession, being led by interest and desire, was fun. It felt like such a guilty pleasure." The afternoon sun moves imperceptibly across the window seat. The moment I notice the light shift, Egan tells me, "You know how when you have lived a certain number of years and you find yourself leapfrogging through your life? You sense both the immediacy and the distance of the past? I am making those time leaps in my own life all the time, and I know that informed the book." Then she references Jean-Paul Sartre's novel The Reprieve, saying: "You only start to care about time when you realize that time is finite." Egan delivers this starkly beautiful if somewhat penumbral sentiment in her characteristically sunny, engaged voice—ready to savor the next leap.

Anyone who has passed up a popcorn car-chase flick in favor of a good indie knows how powerful a simple, skillfully told, character-driven story can be. Katherine Shonk does, and Happy Now? (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), her first novel, is proof. It centers on Claire, a late-thirties Chicago artist whose husband of less than two years, Jay, has just jumped off a balcony— on Valentine's Day. Claire met Jay, a psychology professor, after years of failed relationships and tragicomic dates. Jay was sensitive and communicative, owning up to bouts of depression and existential unease. "I mean, don't you ever get sick of yourself?" he asked Claire. "Doesn't it sometimes seem ridiculous that we have to live our entire lives in one consciousness, and there's no escape? Even when we dream, we dream about ourselves. Doesn't that just seem outrageous?" After Jay's suicide and at a thoughtful pace, Claire comes to terms with his death and its stark seeming inevitability. She's not the most likable protagonist—she can be cutting, selfish, even annoyingly naive—but her search for answers is utterly compelling: Who among us hasn't willfully ignored a few red flags for the sake of wanting something so much? Shonk's incisive writing feels effortless, at times stealthy. She's so economical in her descriptions— of a character's mannerisms, clothes, psyche—that she can evoke a resonant image in the space of a sentence. And in delving into Jay's profession, his depression, Claire's denial, and her family's many forms of dysfunction, Shonk raises compelling questions about the influence of pop psychology. No matter how clued in we are to our emotional baggage and childhood scars, Shonk seems to ask, isn't it basic human nature that at the end of the day, we simply feel what we feel—and what we must?

A terrifically jittery, supercharged energy propels Aryn Kyle's story collection, Boys and Girls Like You and Me (Scribner), the follow-up to her best-selling debut novel, The God of Animals. Kyle's 11 stories feature young women who seem smarter or savvier or sounder than the circumstances in which they find themselves, but who then discover something of value in their reduced states that enables them to move on...not necessarily upward, but onward. In Kyle's universe of female trials, hard times, trickery, and trouble, that latter virtue is—hands down—the more essential, life-enhancing goal.In "Brides," high school freshman Grace, who is an understudy in the school play, says about her drama teacher (who is already having sex with the senior lead), "The first man I slept with kept his eyes closed the whole time." Grace echoes Jillian in "Sex Scenes From a Chain Bookstore," who spills about her married manager-boss, "The first time I had sex with Eric Moe it was on the table in the employee lounge." In "Nine," a girl approaching that age and already a chronic liar lives with her father. Her mother's red raincoat hangs in the closet, a daily reminder of her undiscussed absence. It's a stunning, jarring tale about how children devise ways to survive the false realities their parents create by living in denial.

We Recommend
These are girls and women who don't flinch from complicated or unsavory or confrontational situations, because they have jobs to show up for, bills to pay, and parents, siblings, boyfriends, and best friends to contend with. They are grounded in a refreshing self-centeredness that doesn't sync with a world that still can frown on the nontraditional, the unladylike, the quick and dirty when it comes to women's dreams, desires, and deeds.What a confident batch of stories Kyle has turned out, full of spirited female rebels who can take or leave "no" for an answer and who will not get taken down. They are inspired, intrepid characters from a writer who has talent to spare, and then some.

Isabel Allende's new novel, Island Beneath the Sea (Harper), takes us from Haiti to New Orleans, vividly drawing historical and political links between two places lately devastated by natural disasters. In eighteenth-century Saint-Domingue, the French Empire's "Jewel of the Antilles," grand blancs run sugarcane plantations staffed by thousands of African slaves and engage in debauchery that would shock their families back in France. Two remarkable women whose destinies are entwined face the chaos of this time: Violette Boisier, a courtesan and free mulatto; and Tété, a hardworking slave also of mixed race. While Violette accumulates wealth and fantasizes about running away with her military lover, Tété prays that voodoo goddesses will free her. During the slave rebellions that soon overtake the island, both women manage to escape to New Orleans, where they finally connect and use their femininity to survive. (Tété is quiet, kind, and clever, and Violette knows how to manipulate marriage better than anyone, like a biracial Becky Sharp.) Allende energetically relates the struggles, triumphs, and love affairs of these two women with her signature confident breathlessness. She couldn't have known about the earthquake that would ravage Haiti last January, but the crisis makes this epic uncannily relevant.

In the opening pages of So Much for That (Harper), Lionel Shriver's immaculate, hilarious, and authentically dark new novel, Shep Knacker, a burned-out 48-year-old contractor, is packing his bags to flee Westchester County, New York, for the remote African island of Pemba, where "plantations grew not only cloves, but rice, palms, coconut, and mangos." This escape has been Shep's longtime dream, and he has finally bought his ticket, along with one for his wife, Glynis— a jewelrymaker who makes almost no jewelry—and one for his teenage son, if they should care to accompany him. (He's not at all sure they do.) Alas, his plans screech to a halt when Glynis announces that she has cancer. She will need not only Shep (who else to cook the elaborate meals that she will alternately ignore and throw up?) but his job and its health insurance as she begins to fight for her life.If all that makes the book sound bleak and depressing, it reads as anything but, thanks to a cast of characters as absurd and entertaining as they are real, and an array of subject matter that includes money, politics, cosmetic surgery, penis size, sexual desire, art and artists, debilitating genetic disorders, parenthood, anger, spousal ambivalence, and more. "The challenge of writing this book was to make it fun while still bringing you into a world of illness that sooner or later most of us will have to enter," Shriver says by phone from her home in New York (she divides her time between Brooklyn and London). "We need to read about this. But I tried to candy-coat it a bit."

We Recommend
"This" is not only illness itself, but our failures around it, from personal shortcomings to the catastrophe that is the U.S. health care system. Shriver, 52—a journalist and longtime novelist whose seventh book, We Need to Talk About Kevin, won the Orange Prize in 2005— conceived So Much for That after watching a close friend die of mesothelioma despite getting $2 million in chemo and other treatments that extended her life by all of three months. "You ask yourself, `Would her death have been more agonizing if they hadn't done all that?' " Shriver says. "Because she suffered incredibly from the treatments. And even though we all wanted her around, I'm not sure we can afford this sort of sentimentality."Shriver thinks we could all be more mindful of our aversion to dealing with people who are very ill. "Realize that this could be you. Any day now!" she says, adding that we also "all need to learn to face our own deaths. The medical establishment [advises] that you just keep moving from therapy to therapy—you, as Shep puts it, are `never saying die.' " Thus are people denied the ability to face what's really happening. "The fact that Glynis refuses to admit she's dying puts her friends and family in a terrible position, because it means they can't really talk to one another," Shriver says, adding that her own friend's inability to accept her impending death "cheated me, and cheated her husband. We never got to say goodbye."Will Glynis survive? Will Shep ever get to Pemba? Can we even be truly free from complexity and anxiety, as Shep thinks island life would be? "Personally, I probably couldn't retire to Pemba," Shriver says. "I mean, I thrive on anxiety and complexity. But I do believe that modern life in places like New York—or just about anywhere in the U.S., for that matter—is trying, vexing, and complicated. And tedious! All the software, the passwords.... So I am sympathetic to the idea of Can I find a simpler life? And I'm hopeful that for some people, that is achievable."

Michael Beard, the antihero of Ian McEwan's new novel, Solar (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday), is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who's pushing 60. He's portly, balding, and short, and his best work is many decades behind him. He's just learned that his much-younger fifth wife is having an affair with their not-too-bright contractor. That it serves him right, since he's never been faithful to any of his wives, does not in any way mitigate the obsessive, irrational funk he falls into.As his marriage disintegrates, Beard craftily finesses the accidental death of a character both personally and professionally connected to him in order to bring maximum advantage to himself. He spends a surreal time on a ship in a fjord with "climate change artists," upchucks salmon sandwiches behind the curtain of the stage where he's just delivered a talk, and heads for the New Mexico desert, armed with a scheme to save the world with artificial photosynthesis.

We Recommend
Solar's tone is sober regarding the issue of climate change, but McEwan is otherwise in an unusually mordant and playful mood in this glittering, gimlet-eyed comic novel, more akin to the work of his friend Martin Amis than McEwan's own. Beard has been endowed by his creator with few redeeming qualities: He is manipulative, hypocritical, vain, lying, and jaundiced, but he's not entirely unlikeable: He's too honest, with himself and with us, to hate; and he gets his comeuppance in so many hilarious ways that it's impossible to do anything but laugh at him.McEwan has created in Beard a metaphor for a bloated, struggling, polluted planet headed for disaster. Despite warning signs of imminent trouble and ongoing Kyoto-treaty-like agreements with himself to lose weight and shape up, Beard keeps getting fatter and falling more deeply and irrevocably into entropy and chaos. And so it goes with our species, too. Solar is balls-out, inventive, and brilliant.

John Jude Parish, the lanky 18- year-old North Carolinian skate and surfboarding spiritual seeker in Pearl Abraham's American Taliban (Random House), is an impressive fictive conjuring of the story of John Walker Lindh. Lindh, currently doing 20 years in jail for serving in the Taliban, was the young Californian who, months after 9/11, emerged naked, emaciated, and bleeding from Afghanistan and was forever seared into our collective imagination as the first homegrown terrorist of the Al Qaeda era.While the physical resemblance between Parish and Lindh may be deliberate, Abraham sets her own political, philosophical, regional, and familial agenda to draw the reader into Parish's increasingly secretive, isolated, and radicalized world. "When he wasn't on water," the Brown University–deferring teen "lived on wheels. He believed in continuous adaptation." He worships Dylan and Marley, Emerson, Whitman, and Hegel and fervently studies world religions.

We Recommend
While recuperating from a skateboarding injury, Parish gets caught up in a new Internet relationship. Before he's off crutches, he moves to Brooklyn, where he meets and falls in love with his chat-room friend Noor, whose family is traditional Muslim.Parish's journey to Pakistan in May 2001 accelerates his submersion in militant Islam, placing him in an all-male world of indoctrination and cutting him off from family and friends. Eventually, the 6' former skater-surfer teen intellectual who "made it a rule not to walk on terra firma" disappears.It's a heart- and mind-provoking tale that Abraham, who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, has fashioned with nerve, verve, and righteous vigor.

Shortly after I'd given birth to my first child, a friend slipped me surreptitiously, almost brown-wrapper style, a book that I think might have saved my life. It was A Life's Work: On Becoming a Mother, a 2001 memoir in which British writer Rachel Cusk examines with a vicious lack of sentimentality the pain of having her former life and self ripped away with the arrival of her newborn. The plot is circumscribed, as a new mother's is, and divinely, baroquely expansive with detail. Cusk spends pages describing a torturous morning trying to get her daughter to stop crying and nap. "In the silent kitchen we sit, the baby watching me with bead bright, unfathomable eyes as she feeds, I watching her as one would watch some exotic, uncaged animal, wondering what she is going to do next."A Life's Work offered me my first true escape from the claustrophobic prison in which I'd found myself since the birth of my son, not because it was a trip away from reality, but toward it. With a tearful sense of exhilaration and release, I suddenly could admit to my own ugly truths and emerge from what seemed like an almost fascistic requirement to dissemble. For I'd quickly realized, first in mothers' groups I joined in Manhattan and Brooklyn and even with my more simpatico newmother friends, that imagining one's infant as foreign to oneself as an uncaged animal was unmentionable. (More typical was the tale of one woman in the Brooklyn group who related how she took her very first few hours alone post-birth to drive to an outlet mall and buy her baby a hideous pantsuit appliquéd with ice skaters and glitter.) I found myself wading through relentless conversations about feeding schedules, in part invested in the topic, but in part frantically searching for a clearing in which to cry, "No, no...but how do you really feel? Isn't it awful?" If I managed to mutter a few words to that effect, I might collect a round of commiserating nods, but what wasn't countenanced was the notion that an in-depth discussion of the experience of having your life shattered beyond recognition might be more productive than pondering which Lamaze-endorsed toy baby liked best.

We Recommend
Given that history, it's not surprising, I suppose, that my balm is other women's bomb. Still read and discussed avidly by new mothers, A Life's Work has become a cultishly worshipped or despised book, what the mother of one of my son's classmates calls "the great delineator on the playground. Those who get her have an immediate bonding point. Those who don't will never be my friend." The haters accuse Cusk of despising children, despising mothers, of being an unforgivable whiner, an ingrate. Cusk's crime seems to be my own: wanting not only to admit the sorrow that is part of the narcissistic blow of becoming a parent but wanting to dwell on all its fecund particulars. "The crying has stopped," Cusk writes of her daughter's colic. "She has survived the first pain of existence and out of it wrought herself. And she has wrought me, too, because, although I have not helped or understood, I have been there all along and this, I suddenly and certainly know, is motherhood; this mere sufficiency, this presence. With every cry she has tutored me, in what is plain and hard: that my affection, my silly entertainments, my doting hours, this particular self I tried to bring to my care of her, have been as superfluous as my fury and despair. All that is required is for me to be there; an `all' that is of course everything, because being there involves not being anywhere else.... Being myself is no compensation for not being there."Now comes Cusk's latest work, a novel called The Bradshaw Variations. The book, due out this month, does not disappoint. Like a genius gem cutter, Cusk continues to brazenly flout the pure realism that dominates current literary fiction in favor of a Woolfean approach that uses style and sensory impressionism to chisel out inner turmoil. The Bradshaw Variations is a timely, necessary story about a year in the life of a husband (Thomas) and wife (Tonie) who upend their former division of labor: She takes a job heading the English department at the university where she used to teach part-time, while he agrees to leave the corporate sphere to devote himself to caring for the couple's eightyear- old daughter and take up his piano playing more seriously.The subject matter is not astonishing, except perhaps in its surface banality, but the tone—and maybe what you'd call the level of artistry—is. For both men and women, whether to work or not—and whether and how we will have successful marriages and happy children, based on our levels of working or not—is probably one of the central preoccupations of contemporary life (in those parts of the world where getting enough food isn't the central concern).Yet mostly what we've gotten in literary response to this collective conflict are comic, rueful takes along the lines of the fun but slight novel I Don't Know How She Does It, by Allison Pearson, or the well-executed but undemanding Slate column Freaky Fortnight, coauthored by a stay-at-home mom and a Slate editor who switch jobs for two weeks. And then there are the diatribes: We must work and have two children (Leslie Bennetts, The Feminine Mistake: Are We Giving Up Too Much?); we must work but have only one child (Linda R. Hirshman, Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World); we must work but pretend that we don't in public (Caitlin Flanagan); we must not work, and get married when we are 19 (Danielle Crittenden, What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman). Cusk's approach does not proscribe, nor does it disregard by using farce as a deke out. What it does, other than entertain, is take seriously the immensity of the psychic arena devoted to these choices we make.

We Recommend
"With this book, I wanted to get out how amazingly difficult it is for a man to feel it's right to be at home looking after children and for a woman to feel it's right for her to be playing second fiddle, the one who is not primarily responsible for the children," Cusk says when I interview her from her home in Bristol, UK, which she shares with her photographer husband, their two daughters, and Cusk's stepdaughter. Our unruly emotions refuse to heel, Cusk goes on, "no matter how much we try to live the life of feminist possibility of [women] continuing to work while having children...I wanted to describe how people can't try to do these things unless deeply in their hearts they refute the role of mother and father that is imprinted on their psyche from childhood."

In short, The Bradshaw Variations does for midlife working parents what A Life's Work did for new mothers. Which is another way of saying that I'm expecting the new book to be as polarizing as Life's Work, and, actually, as polarizing as Cusk's previous novel Arlington Park, about a day in the life of a group of women in a provincial British city—a poetic, dazzlingly intelligent, at times scathing, at times deeply sympathetic examination of contemporary womanhood. Released in 2006, the book got its share of five-star, why-didn't-this-win-the- Booker? praise, but its detractors were equally vehement. The main plaint in both lay and professional forums? Cusk's protagonists were not nice. As one Amazon reviewer, who, near the end of her denunciation suggests that Cusk must be a chronic depressive based on the "lank" hair in her author photo, put it, "It is very difficult to continue reading a book when you cannot stand a single character. These women were repulsive to me: thoughtless, insensitive, unloving." The literati's attack mode, meanwhile, was to call the book "shrill" in a dismissive capsule review (The New Yorker) and, over at The New York Times Book Review, to assign it to another UK-based female author (itself a ghettoizing choice), who was unusually vicious by soft-pedaling Book Review standards. "There are some great moments," Lucy Ellmann wrote, "but [Cusk] tends to over-egg the pudding with metaphor, simile, and melodramatic hyperbole when all she's describing is a set of materially advantaged women getting through the day."

We Recommend
As a materially advantaged—relatively speaking—woman myself whose primary drama, when it comes down to it, is getting through the day, I wondered anew why my pudding was deemed over-egged if it was honored with metaphors, similes, and hyperbole. After all, aren't these the primary figures of speech that writers concerned with writing as art use as their tools? The obvious assessment is that this is a sexist dismissal of the domestic as a worthy subject, but that strikes me as a decoy. Books by her contemporaries, such as Jonathan Franzen's plot-laden The Corrections or Lorrie Moore's critically praised A Gate at the Stairs, are about family. Then, too, why the edge of fury in Ellmann's tone? Perhaps what bothered her was really something else—something, dare I say, personal: Arlington Park, Ellmann wrote at another point in her review, is "the kind of book that makes you burn things on the stove and berate your husband."Cusk, who is 43, tells me that she believes the generation of writers above hers, the Doris Lessings and Angela Carters, were willing to truly grapple with the conflicts in women's lives, while her peers skirt them. Partly, she blames this on female writers' fear that they'll be dismissed if they dwell too much on their own lives, but Cusk also muses about a larger cultural regression, a general "decision to turn your back on the possibilities of feminism," and instead "to prize dependence on a man and the creation of children and the material reality of home, all of these capitalist, bourgeoise ways of being."While Cusk professes what might sound like an outdated brand of feminism—arguing that fulfilling work or a purpose beyond child care is a necessity for women, and that we're refusing to admit we're making a choice when we not only embrace patriarchal values but require a certain level of financial comfort—her books say something that is newer and more radical.

We Recommend
In not shrinking from what is despairing or unloving in her characters (who are, of course, us) and in limning so assiduously the shifting movements of their interior worlds—with their embedded layers of genetics, nurture, immediate sensory onslaughts, and physical embodiment in a frail animal shell—she tells us that none of our choices are easy, or without repercussions, and to pretend otherwise is to live falsely. What her writing pushes against is how we are expected, both women and men, to go along with a version of things that almost continuously denies how it really feels to live right now, whether we're looking after children or out working, procreators or not, rich or poor. In The Bradshaw Variations, she describes Thomas remembering his corporate day: "It comes to him, the physical feeling of his London office, the big steel and Perspex building with its wires and blinking screens and shrilling telephones, the bitter smell of plastic and electric light, the hushed grey spaces, the sealed windows muffling the world—everyone so chemical smelling and costumed, and the way people spoke, language itself made artificial, so that you found yourself looking at their teeth, their eyes, to remind yourself there was a human being in there. And most of all the feeling of being on board, of living in a never-resolving present, the feeling that all this artificiality could be sustained so long as it was never permitted to slip into the past. He remembers the way reality itself was made unreal."It's a rebellious decision for Cusk to fix her eye, unwaveringly, on the truths of being flawed, troubled selves who make choices that feel like traps, and saying, by taking this inner experience to the level of art, that it's perhaps more meaningful than anything else. Our inner lives are feminism's last forbidden frontier. It might be the female artists who have to fight for the value in examining them, because women have more of a history of adventuring in the internal (think of Penelope at home at her loom while Odysseus travels the high seas), but it's vital for men and women.

We Recommend
In the early '90s, when the book Listening to Prozac first came out, I remember a friend saying, "We'll have to run away into the forest and create our own little society of the last angry people." Now, almost 20 years later, what he predicted has arguably come to pass. Anger, ambivalence, simply a vision of ourselves as emotionally complex people—operating as much out of vindictiveness, fear, and low-level depression as happiness—are considered unproductive, possibly immoral. In the way that having genetically yellow teeth is now considered a hygiene problem that can and should be taken care of, so are our emotional lives, the stains erased and the inevitably continuing decay kept far from view. As the public whitens its teeth into a pained, blueish translucency, and embraces what Cusk calls the "just get on with it" culture (heaven forfend we should look too closely at just what, exactly, we are getting on with, and where it is going to get us), I'm escaping to the metaphorical forest with a pile of Cusk novels. I hope you'll be brave enough to join me.

Chang-Rae Lee's The Surrendered (Riverhead) opens with the sentence, "The journey was nearly over." Riding atop a boxcar, huddling under a thin blanket with her doomed little brother and sister, is June Han, an 11-year-old Korean whose journey is, in fact, just beginning. She is only one of many orphans who populate this beautiful, riveting, piercingly haunting book. Epic in scope, the story opens in Korea in 1950, then goes back to Japanese- occupied Manchuria in 1934 and forward to Fort Lee, New Jersey, and Italy in 1986. The settings and times are masterfully interwoven to form an elegant, disturbing inquiry into courage, love, loyalty, and mercy.At the center of the story are three orphans: June and two Americans, Hector Brennan and Sylvie Tanner, who are both damaged by their pasts and blessed (or cursed) with almost mythic beauty, superhuman strength, and vast, unknowable mystery. These characters converge at a Korean orphanage shortly after the novel's opening scene; all three lives are dramatically and irrevocably changed by their confluence.

We Recommend
Although narrated in unpretentious, often conversational prose, this novel is terrifyingly violent, unrelentingly brutal, and shocking. Lee gives his characters horrific fates, has them grapple with staggering amounts of pain—internal and circumstantial, emotional and physical— and endows them all with the strengths necessary to face it. This careful, finely wrought balance of character and plot imbues the book with grace and hope in spite of its horrors.Lee's one notable misstep occurs about threequarters of the way through, in 1986 New Jersey, when two highly sympathetic minor characters seem to be killed off merely for the sake of plot convenience and gratuitous pathos. Aside from this lapse, the book's considerable violence feels necessary, organic, and all too believable. This is a book to read in two or three long sittings, gulping pages, turning them as fast as possible to reach the perfect, inevitable ending.

Louise Erdrich writes stories with long roots and remarkable reach, spanning generations of Native Americans and other Midwesterners. Yet it's her ability to home in on the small, searing exchanges between people that tip their relationship in some new direction—for better or worse— that amazes the most. Her new novel, Shadow Tag (HarperCollins), revolves around a Minneapolis couple, Gil and Irene, parents of three children— he a painter, she a historian researching George Catlin, the renowned nineteenth-century portraitist and exploiter of American Indians.Gil, given to smacking the older kids when his temper flares, and Irene, so devoted to her nighttime wine that her six-year-old draws her with glass in hand, are in serious trouble—the initial lust and admiration between them now obscured by Gil's jealousy of Irene's motherly devotion. In an attempt to get Gil to leave them, Irene starts writing about invented trysts in a diary she knows he's reading. The ruse seems a bit far-fetched— but then there's Gil, having snuck the diary from the back of a drawer in Irene's basement office, thinking "he could feel the blood drain from his heart," so overcome that he seems to be falling apart right there in the room with you. Later, as they're about to head out to a party, Irene realizes Gil has read her latest entry—one so ridiculously romantic she thought about ripping it out before the wine spurred her on. "I'm going to be with the handsomest man at the party," she says brightly, trying to undo the blow she's already landed.

We Recommend
Such moments of sudden, startling emotional apprehension, and the course corrections they produce, push Gil and Irene and their kids closer and further apart by turns. As the family moved toward some resolution—because the status quo clearly could not stand—I kept flipping to Erdrich's author photo for a clue as to how she created this particularly devastating little world. But her sideways glance and mild smile suggested a woman happy to preserve some mystery, which, I suppose, is a great writer's prerogative.

In Hot Springs (Tin House), his rollicking new novel, Geoffrey Becker has assembled a delicate collage of damaged souls. Bernice, a volatile, restless, and subtly unhinged woman, kidnaps Emily, the daughter she gave up for adoption five years earlier, and lights out across America to Tucson and, later, Baltimore; Landis, her world-weary boyfriend and accomplice, is compelled by Bernice and her cause in spite of himself; and Tessa, Emily's conservative Christian adoptive mother in Colorado Springs, is forced by the abduction to face the unhappy, unholy truth about her marriage.No one in this ensemble is particularly likable (or anyone you'd want to bump into at a bar), but Becker gives them to us with such earnest and empathetic insight that he makes us root for even the most ungracious among them. In their poignant tragicomic entanglements, none of these folks seems to mean anyone any harm in the course of pursuing their dreams—it's just that everyone else becomes collateral damage. They all believe that a fiveyear- old girl will redeem their failed lives—but then find themselves wandering further than ever from the Promised Land. "Many evenings [Landis] had sat out staring down on the lights of the sprawling city, drinking a beer, pretending he owned the world," Becker writes. "It hadn't been happiness, exactly, not in the sense that he'd always assumed people were supposed to be happy, either with a lot of money or a big loving family, or maybe pursuing some dream like photographing bears at the South Pole, or even having sex with movie stars.... But there had been a stillness, the sky over him a great inverted bowl full of stars, and some nights that was exactly what he wanted."

The art-history-meets-art-mystery novel The Swan Thieves (Little, Brown) kicks off with a crime of passion: A painter named Robert Oliver tries to attack a canvas at Washington, DC's National Gallery. Why he dunnit? As in Elizabeth Kostova's previous best-seller, The Historian, the gathering of clues involves revisiting the past. Psychiatrist Andrew Marlow becomes so obsessed with his taciturn patient that he tracks down Oliver's intimates, through whom we become thoroughly acquainted with the enigmatic artist. After several hundred pages, we focus less on the museum mystery than on these characters' painfully realistic domestic lives. Both of Oliver's former partners were artists, as was the nineteenth-century French housewife whose letters he collected and on whom he has an impossible crush. Yet all three had to choose between making art and having a family. As Oliver's ex-wife angrily recalls, "I never slept more than a few hours.... I did all the dull work of keeping the household going, I had no chance to paint unless I skipped even more sleep, and I couldn't do that, so I didn't paint." Kostova doesn't solve the puzzle of how to reconcile creative fulfillment and independence with wifehood, motherhood, and domestic responsibility, but it's fascinating— and heartbreaking—to watch her characters try.

In Model Home (Scribner), muchpraised short story writer Eric Puchner goes after a subject that can easily provoke shudders, sighs, eye rolls, or, for those of us who are lucky, feelings of love and acceptance. Oh, family! This novel, Puchner's first, following his successful 2005 story collection, Music Through the Floor, zooms in on the Zillers, who seem to fit squarely into the mid-'80s quotidian experience: Dad has just moved Mom, three kids, and dog from Wisconsin to L.A. for a risky real estate venture that he promises will help them afford their newly leased car, expensive furniture, and sprawling McMansion in a ritzy zip code (you can see where this is going), and Mom produces squeaky-clean sexeducation videos for teens. When Dad runs out of money (and out of ways to conceal their financial woes), the family dynamic quickly crumbles and everyone must adapt. Eldest son Dustin, an aspiring punk rocker, is already dealing with disagreeable bandmates and lust for his girlfriend's sister. Middle daughter Lyle, 16, is having sex with their gated community's 19-year-old security guard in between doling out scoops at the local ice cream parlor. And youngest son Jonas dresses monochromatically and brings up the subject of death at breakfast.How the Zillers adjust to a dwindling bank account and rampant teenage angst is the heart of the matter, but what's most impressive is Puchner's ability to keep his characters so relatable, even when juggling them from an omniscient point of view. We feel equally connected to an OCD 11-year-old who refuses to wear any color besides orange and a middleaged husband who, in his efforts to save face, pretends his car was stolen, not repossessed. Puchner even gets the women right, hormonal teen and burned-out mom alike—so much so that we'd gladly be the fourth child in the Zillers' dark, funny, completely human story.

Adam Haslett's Union Atlantic (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday) is an intensely atmospheric, psychedelically tinged debut novel that casts an alternately pleasurable and punishing aura, within which an odd mélange of Boston-area bankers, teachers, students, addicts, warriors, and a pair of messianic dogs enact their inevitable destinies.The social, cultural, personal, and professional pornographies that Haslett explores—including war, greed, illicit relations, sexism, and suicide— are laid out with a forensic formality through which startling passages of lyric precision and picturesqueness frequently emerge.In one chilling snapshot of Doug Fanning, the wily, sadistic banker and ex-soldier at the center of the story, Haslett writes, "That's what he was for [them]: an attractive weapon. Doug worked best with the men who understood implicitly the balance of excitement, ignorance and reward he offered."

We Recommend
Pitted against Doug, who builds a "casino of a house" while expanding his strategic role in a massive investment fraud at Union Atlantic bank, is his elderly high-Anglican neighbor, Charlotte Graves, an ex-teacher on whose ancestral land Doug's near-empty pile scoffingly sits. Among the developments that adroitly up the narrative stakes: Charlotte's brother, Henry, heads the New York Federal Reserve; her naive young student Nate has a mad crush on Doug; and her two rescue dogs—a mastiff and a Doberman— talk to her in preacher/activist (think Cotton Mather and Malcolm X) end-of-days locutions.The novel, which follows the author's widely praised best-selling story collection, You Are Not a Stranger Here, gradually builds into a darkly complex and viscerally disturbing turn-of-the- twenty- first-century morality tale about the individual and communal costs of America's checkered history of financial malfeasance, racism, youth worship, the built-in brutality of warfare, and the slim chances, if any, that such a culture offers for redress or redemption.Union Atlantic is a bleak, brazen beauty of a book.

As she did unforgettably in her best-selling 2007 novel, Away, Amy Bloom has death dancing at the margins, then suddenly spinning center stage in her new story collection, Where the God of Love Hangs Out (Random House). Bloom's richly drawn characters here are a motley crew: a once bitterly cruel husband and father startling his daughter by settling into humble decency in his widowed dotage; a lanky lothario smashing a juicy peach into his pudgy little brother's face to coach him on the art of cunnilingus; and a lonely social worker writing long letters about doomed polar expeditions to one of her former clients, to name a few.In each story—and particularly in the two separate quartets of tales in the book, subtitled " William and Clare" and "Lionel and Julia," about two very different love affairs moving through and beyond sexual ecstasy—what satisfies most are the author's gifts for compression. We apprehend precisely the changes people have gone through over time and how, inevitably, parts of life that are hard and soft, sharp and sweet spring into stark relief when mortality looms. Lionel, who stormed his stepmother Julia's bed, ravishing her with a 19-year-old's drunken fury after his father's wake in the story "Sleepwalking," catches sight of her naked again in "Night Vision," when, drunk on a trip back home after many years away, he falls on broken glass, and Julia leaps out of bed to his aid. "She knelt down, pushing back my hair to get a better look at me. Her breasts swung down, half in, half out of the hallway's dusty light," Lionel recalls. "I could see her, both more and less clearly than I would have liked." And in that "both more and less" moment, when something is yearned for yet also faded, and fading still further beyond reach, Bloom bravely exposes the double-edged nature of sex and romantic love, her two great subjects.

Each of the stories in Alice Munro's new collection, Too Much Happiness (Knopf), reads like a novel, not in miniature, but—miraculously, magically— in full. The title story was inspired by Munro's chance discovery of, and obsession with, the late-nineteenth-century Russian mathematician and novelist Sophia Kovalevsky. The novella- length tale focuses on her final days, using flashbacks to flesh out the extraordinary life and times of this brilliant, virtually forgotten visionary. Writes Munro of the widowed Kovalevsky's complex relationship with fellow intellectual and former in-law Maksim Kovalevsky, whom she first met in Sweden in 1888: "They flew at each other as if they had indeed been longlost relatives. A torrent of jokes and questions followed, an immediate understanding, a rich gabble of Russian, as if the languages of Western Europe had been flimsy formal cages in which they had been too long confined, or paltry substitutes for true human speech. Their behavior, as well, soon overflowed the proprieties of Stockholm. He stayed late at her apartment. She went alone to lunch with him at his hotel."The nine other stories in the much-lauded Canadian writer's twelfth collection—her many titles include The Love of a Good Woman, The View from Castle Rock, Runaway, and Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage—delve lustily into the fleeting delights and more durable disturbances of the human condition. "Dimensions" bares the shocking choices a mother makes after her children are murdered by her criminally insane husband; the spookily suspenseful "Free Radicals" follows a standoff between an elderly woman and the stranger who invades her home; "Face" is a spellbinding portrait of a boy born with a port-wine-stain birthmark that covers half his face; and "Child's Play" concerns the ploys and plotting of a creepy kid who crows, "I was awkward, precocious, timid, full of my private rituals and aversions."That line, like this entire tour-de-force volume, is classic Munro—at once deep, devilish, and divine.

Three decades before Bella and Edward laid their hungry eyes on each other (and 14 years ­before Kristen Stewart was even born), a very ­different breed of vampire was making readers blush and swoon. Unlike Stephenie Meyer's ­courtly gentlemen of the night, the pansexual lotharios of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles had few qualms about kissing, killing, and converting hapless ­mortals. But since laying her vampires to rest in 2002, Rice has returned to the Catholic church and produced work more compatible with her faith.Angel Time (Knopf), the first volume in Rice's new cycle, Songs of the Seraphim, focuses on Toby O'Dare, an ambivalent assassin who enjoys ­reading history and practicing the lute on the side. Just after he completes a big hit, Toby is recruited by an angel to ­return to thirteenth-century England to save an innocent Jewish couple from execution by a ­village mob. During his time-traveling quest, Toby seeks and finds salvation and redemption. The ­violence-­drenched backstory of why Toby crossed over to the dark side veers delightfully into vintage Rice but has little ­relevance to the medieval subplot. Rice's vampires left an indelible mark, but fans of Lestat & Co. may find this new ­undertaking a little lacking in bite.

There Once Lived a Woman Who Tried to Kill Her Neighbor's Baby (Penguin Books), by Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, gave me nightmares. This celebrated Russian author (now 71) is so disquieting that long after Solzhenitsyn had been published in the Soviet Union, her fiction was banned—even though nothing about it screams "political" or "dissident" or anything else. It just screams.These stories work the boundary states of consciousness—between sleep and waking, hallucination and realization, life and death—like a tongue works an aching tooth. You never know where you are or where you're going, because the ground beneath the narratives is constantly shifting. You know only that the world you are in is as bleak as Beckett, as astringent as witch hazel, as poetic as your finest private passing moments.If there's any justice, this humble paperback will be greeted as the pinnacle of modern literature that it is—but as Petrushevskaya would be the first to say, to hope for justice is to invite mockery. Better to just keep your head down and write...like this.

Who wouldn't want to feel happy all the time? In Generosity: An Enhancement (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), the tenth novel by Richard Powers (a Mac­Arthur ­genius whose last book, The Echo Maker, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist), Russell Stone is a mild-mannered writing teacher who finds one of his students, 23-year-old refugee Thassa Amzwar, to be preter­naturally joyful. Obsessed by how her good mood persists despite the ­horrors she survived in Algeria and the urban indig­nities she faces in Chicago, ­Russell starts to suspect it's all due to gene­tics. But when he carelessly outs Thassa to the happiness-mad world, the woman known as "Miss Generosity" and "Bliss Chick" to her classmates becomes the goose with the ­golden egg to a scientist bent on replicating and profiting from her "happy gene." The ensuing media circus and science frenzy threaten to take ­Thassa down, and Russell tries to save her, whatever the cost to himself and the woman he plans to marry. Powers' achievement is to depict Thassa without annoyingly caricaturing her in a novel that's not about the struggle between glad and sad but about the ­vulnerability of fragile joys to ­humans who are emotionally stunted but techno­logically advanced.

Don't hate her because she's got as many varieties as Heinz.... Yes, it seems as if it takes Joyce Carol Oates less time to churn out another book than it takes other women to get a spa treatment, but how can we begrudge her when she produces, for the most part, such satisfying pageturners? In her new small-town saga, Little Bird of Heaven (Ecco), the murder of a sparkly songstress with big-city dreams links the fates of two teens whose fathers are each suspected of committing the crime. Set in the 1980s in upstate New York (not far from where the writer grew up), it's vintage Oates: tragic violence, outsize ambitions, dashed hopes, strained family bonds, manly-men roughing up sassy-yet-submissive women, and, of course, sex-crazed teenagers. Oates has a special knack for evoking the intense eroticism of adolescence, and the dangerous attraction here between a tentative daddy's girl and an old-for-his-age bad boy is reminiscent of her famous story "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" We end up more interested in the resolution of the teens' pas de deux and their relationships with their persecuted fathers than in resolving the murder mystery—and, seemingly, so does Oates.

In Homer & Langley (Random House), E. L. Doctorow (Ragtime, The Book of Daniel) borrows from the lives of the infamously eccentric Collyer brothers, one blind, one shell-shocked in World War I, to create a seemingly claustrophobic yet cunningly panoramic tale into which the seminal events of twentieth-century America—wars, the Jazz Age, racial tensions, the peace movement—imaginatively seep.Narrated by younger brother Homer, whose brilliant intuitive vision compensates for his childhood loss of sight, the novel homes in on the brothers' wealthy Manhattan upbringing, their failed attempts at love, Homer's musical creativity, and Langley's deranged ingenuity, as their Fifth Avenue townhouse becomes a living repository of their peculiar personal histories and an unlikely showcase for the country's fads, scandals, celebrations, and upheavals.

We Recommend
Langley compulsively collects the daily papers "with the ultimate aim of creating one day's edition of a newspaper that could be read forevermore," until "his...bales and boxes of clippings rose from floor to ceiling in every room."Over the decades, rare ephemera and plain old junk increasingly clutter the place: books, skis, fans, suitcases, a Chinese amphora, two pianos, record players, radios, rifles, photos, a TV, and a Model T, lifted piece by piece into the house and reassembled by Langley in the dining room.Doctorow has packed this tale with episodes of existential wonder that capture the brothers in all their fascinating wackiness.

Heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, author of four memoirs and two novels, gets hot and heavy in her latest, Obsession, out this month. The erotic tale centers around Priscilla, who finds steamy letters written between her recently passed husband and a mistress. And so begins her obsession, and our (and probably Vanderbilt's son Anderson Cooper's) blushing.

Carolina De Robertis' incantatory debut novel, The Invisible Mountain (Knopf), is both an homage to and a reckoning with Uruguay, her small, historically dictator-dominated ancestral South American homeland. Her sweeping and lushly lyrical saga spans three generations of the Firielli family's women—Pajarita; her daughter, Eva; and Eva's daughter, Salomé—starting at the threshold of the twentieth century and moving through successive decades of apparent quietude, life-affirming upheavals, and bloody government crackdowns centered in the capital city of Montevideo.In her boldly poetic yet earthbound prose, De Robertis—a polyglot who grew up in England, the United States, and Switzerland—writes, "Monte. Vide. Eu. I see a mountain, said a Portuguese man, among the first Europeans to sight this terrain from the sea. City of sailors and workers, of wool and steak, of gray stones and long nights, biting-cold winters and Januaries so humid you could swim through hot air. City of seekers. Port of a hundred flags. Heart and edge of Uruguay."

We Recommend
From the infant death of Pajarita, who is then magically resurrected, found high up in a tree, and so named "Little Bird," to the painful sexual and political awakenings of the poet Eva, who ventures to Perón's Argentina and back, to the brutal imprisonment, multiple rapes, and near-death of the revolutionary Salomé, these women face down the stark choices and consequences of their interconnected lives in a long-shrouded country. This visionary book beautifully, bravely breaks open all the old secrets.

If life is all about choices, as the saying goes, then what happens when we ­simply can't make up our minds about what's most important? In her second volume of short stories, Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It (Riverhead), acclaimed ­novelist Maile Meloy (Liars and Saints, A Family Daughter), who first stunned critics in 2002 with her debut story collection, Half in Love, cracks at our nagging desire to have it all (the answers, the romance, the payout, and, in one case, the late grandmother come back to life) in 11 tightly written, ­remarkably fluid narratives, most of which ­unfold in sleepy towns across Meloy's native Montana.As Meloy's characters tend to discover, there's a catch to having everything both ways. In "The Girlfriend," Leo, in order to ­dis­cover the truth behind his daughter's mysterious disappearance, must learn that his call to the cops changed the course of her fate; in "Two-Step," Alice comforts a friend who is weathering marital ­difficulties, even though Alice is the proximate cause of the ­trouble; and in "Liliana," a recently laid-off family man hopes against hope that his distant (but extremely wealthy) grandmother, whom he had thought was dead, will reconsider him in her will when she makes an appearance at his home. Throughout these emotional tugs-of-war decorated with precise details (the Mountain Fresh ­detergent that scented the pillowcase, the Springsteen song that was playing), Meloy doesn't always deliver an intense aha! moment or let us in on exactly what their significance is. The truth is that, as their turmoil dies away, it's up to us to decide.

You know it when you see it: the ability to conjure whole lives, times, places, worlds in a few deft splashes of prose, Picasso-esque line drawings of the mind, without resort to attitudinal or perspectival gambits, language games, postmodern devices. Plenty of people have recognized the sure-handed literary classicism of Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Just two years out of college, she produced a bildungsroman set in her homeland, Purple Hibiscus(2003), that won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for best first book. In 2006, Half of a Yellow Sun, her epic about the Biafran War in the 1960s, earned her widespread popular and critical acclaim as well as the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction. And last year, Adichie, now 31, was awarded a MacArthur "genius" grant that, she has said, frees her to live where she wishes (in both America and Nigeria) and to devote herself full-time to her writing.Now comes her collection of a dozen stories, The Thing Around Your Neck(Knopf), half set in Nigeria,and—in a creative departure for Adichie—the other half in America. Perhaps it's no surprise that, despite Adichie's familiarity with U.S. life (she came here to go to college and recently earned an MA in African Studies from Yale), the stories set stateside fall into a fairly narrow amplitude of immigration/assimilation/ alienation narratives. Their characters—an arranged-marriage bride who finds herself in a fleabag apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn; a wife in a dream home on suburban Philadelphia's Main Line whose husband is apparently cavorting with a sweet young thing in the bedroom of their Lagos home; and so on—are stymied by home ties and bemused by America.

We Recommend
Still, the coloration and vigor of these stories rarely pale, and Adichie's supple talents are on full display in her African tales, which never fail to touch the universal in the particular experience of the aging revolutionary professor, the fallen bourgeois golden boy, the shopping-crazy gal caught up in a marketplace massacre. Like most of us—but perhaps more so—Adichie's imagination seems fired by nostalgia for a lost childhood world at least as much as by the challenges of the ever-moving present tense that has swept it so unceremoniously, irretrievably away.

Emily Chenoweth's debut novel, Hello Goodbye (Random House), is a tender ode to empathy and how even awkward, bumbling gestures and comments can be received as grace. Helen Hansen, a counselor, jogger, homemaker, and mom, has been diagnosed with brain cancer. In the sixth month of her illness, Helen is driven by her husband, Elliott, and their college-age daughter, Abby, to a majestic hotel in New Hampshire, where old friends join them. Here Chenoweth explores the effect of stress and misfortune on a group that includes three other couples as well as two young hotel employees who are smitten with Abby's fresh loveliness.

We Recommend
 While the poignant situation has a profound effect on everyone present, spurring them to comfort Helen, Elliott, and Abby in their own, often eccentric ways, most of the action centers on Abby's love triangle. Even as her mother's condition demands her maturity and poise, Abby can't help being swept away by youthful excitement and sexual curiosity. Chenoweth intimately recalls the painful and thrilling uncertainty of the cusp of adulthood, and Abby fills this novel with energy and hope. From the beginning, we share Elliott's tragic awareness that "in the story of his and Helen's marriage, the end had already been written," but the journey to it never feels like a solemn march to a devastating conclusion—instead, every page of this book serves as an affirmation of the terrible, wrenching beauty of life.

Near the end of How to Sell (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), Clancy Martin's debut novel set amid Dallas' fine jewelry business, narrator Bobby Clark tackles the title question: "How do you sell a diamond to a young ­couple?" "It is very, very easy to do," he ­explains. "Find out who's in charge.... Then focus your attention on the other one...­subtly betray him." Aha! And this is hardly the book's first reveal on the fine art of selling, swindling, and scamming. How to Sell is, with memorably dark comedy, a virtual handbook on fraud.Bobby, a hapless Calgary teen, is lured south by his older ­brother, Jim, a coke-sniffing, smooth-talking jewelry salesman who has sold his soul for the thrill of closing a deal. Bobby mimics his brother's bad habits until they stick and often flirts with danger for its own sake. The world the Clark boys build for themselves and teeter precariously upon—one driven by wads of cash, adrenaline, an indiscriminate lust for sex and money, and a misunder­standing of what in life is really at stake—is a compelling setting for Martin's propulsive storytelling. His narration feels cinematic, the sets and scenery popping off the page. With remarkable skill as the story spools out, Martin omits just enough exposition and interior ­insights to keep his characters shrouded in mystery, as if ­constantly reminding us that we'll always be the customer, never the insider. Speaking of customers, prepare to be a much shrewder one after reading How to Sell; those of tenderer sensibility, however, might heed the adage "Buyer beware."

Lila Nova is a recently divorced 32- year-old ad woman who's too traumatized even to dip her toe into the dating scene. She has retreated to a characterless studio apartment on Manhattan's Union Square with "no memories trapped in the walls or the floorboards. No arguments or harrowing scenes of unrequited love staring at me from the bathroom mirror." Then she catches her boss in a revolting act of Peeping Tomism at a supermodel ad shoot. But this sad-sack everywoman could just as easily have been christened India Jones by first-time novelist Margot Berwin in her shameless guilty pleasure of a romp, Hothouse Flower and the 9 Plants of Desire ( Pantheon), because soon one David Exley, a gorgeously rough-hewn plant-seller dude at the local greenmarket, takes Lila down a rabbit hole into an adventure combining the kinetic, cinematic razzle- dazzle of a Spielberg fantasia with the Mesoamerican metaphysical mojo of Carlos Castaneda, who provides the novel's epigraph and a good deal of its botanically hallucinatory, shape-shifting animal spirits. True, the whole enterprise has a faintly schematic, paraliterary air about it, until the mysterious Armand, who runs a plantfestooned Laundromat on First Avenue, lures Lila into an increasingly desperate rare-plant expedition and vision quest in Mexico's Yucatán that involves black panthers, poisonous snakes, scorpions, and— putting Lila in a very sticky situation—both Mr. Exley and the Adonis-like son of a Huichol Indian shaman. The question of who's using who here opens onto a bewildering hall of mirrors as Lila finds she must draw on her untapped spiritual strengths to extricate herself from a fatally compromised, and compromising, position.

We Recommend
 Berwin is a former ad copywriter who spent a spell in a rural village in the Yucatán and in fact has a friend who owns a Laundromat stuffed with plants, as well as a pal named Armand (the book is dedicated to him). She contends that all resemblances to persons living or dead pretty much stop there. And I have no idea what she was smoking when she cooked up this sultry, psychedelic summer soufflé of a read, to which Julia Roberts has already snapped up the film rights, but...I'll have some of that!

Colson Whitehead, the MacArthur Award–winning author of such highfalutin metafictions as The Intuitionist and John Henry Days, has now written a supremely intuitive first-person coming-of-age novel, Sag Harbor (Doubleday). Whitehead vibrantly imagines his "Autobiographical Fourth Novel" from the formative summers he spent at his family's beach house in the historically African-American Long Island enclave of Azurest.Sag Harbor's narrator is 15-year-old Benji Cooper, a bright black kid who attends a virtually all-white prep school in Manhattan. While Benji's agenda is more private and personal than polemical and political, he peppers his narrative with cogent asides on race, class, sex, religion, and culture. And once Benji arrives on the island for the summer, he weaves a spell that is by turns enchanting, mood-shifting, and side-splitting, sharing the sweet, sad secrets of his mixed-up, mid-'80s adolescence.

We Recommend
With his doctor father and lawyer mother driving out from the city only on some weekends, Benji and his younger brother, Reggie, have the ranch-style house to themselves—along with their near-magically described treks through the woods and along paths down to the beach, and bike rides into town or to neighboring black communities with shared family roots.When not working at a local ice cream shop, Benji hangs with his tight posse of summer pals who listen to music, watch movies and TV, hit the beach, shoot BB guns, then move on to kissing girls and sneaking beers. Family dramas flare up, revealing a bully father beneath the professional polish, a mother whose social poise hides her deference, and an absent sister whose Azurest days seem long gone.Of course, summer must end. But something timeless ties Benji to his history, to his memories, and will always mark his summer days: "I will take the world at its word and allow that there are those who have experienced great love in their lives. This must be so.... There are those who have never loved, and they walk through their days grasping after true connection. And then there is me. Ladies and gentlemen and all of you at home just tuning in, the angel of my heart, my long lost love, was a house."

Ask Reif Larsen, the 28-year-old Brooklynite on whom the Penguin Press reportedly bestowed almost a million dollars for his really quite astounding debut novel, The Selected Works of T. S. Spivet.The story is simple enough: T. S., a science genius and compulsive cartographer who lives with his family of mixed nuts on a Montana ranch, wins a prestigious Smithsonian science award (except, the museum doesn't know he's only 12 years old) and hops an industrial rail to start a new life in DC. But here's the icing on this already luscious piece of fiction: T. S.'s every digression, aside, distraction, and tangential musing is drawn—by him, naturally—in the margins of almost every page: his father's long sips of whiskey over seconds elapsed, or a pie chart depicting "The Four Components of Adventure" (guns and knives, magnifying glasses, adventure pants—and, of course, a map!)."Something about measuring the distance between here and there cast off the mystery of what lay between," T. S. attests about his all-consuming fetish for mapmaking, "and as a child with limited empirical evidence, the unknown of what might just lie between here and there could be terrifying. I, like most children, had never been there. I had barely been here." Funny: Isn't that pretty exactly how you remember it?

The opening of Thrity Umrigar's fourth novel, The Weight of Heaven (Harper), almost—but not quite—prepares us for the torrent of heartache and anguish to come as attractive, successful Frank and Ellie Benton reel from the sudden death of their only child. When Frank is offered a job in India, the couple invests tentative hope in the move, expecting a land of snake charmers and sacred cows that will help them forget—and maybe salvage their crumbling marriage.Unfortunately for the Bentons, this book is no Eat, Pray, Love, and India has other plans for them. Managing a factory in a small village, Frank is plunged into a volatile labor dispute and endless other struggles. The landscape and culture, both evocatively depicted by the India-born Umrigar, provide Ellie with some distractions, but she is dismayed by India's effect on her husband, who begins to turn into a stereotypically obtuse American: "She had certainly not imagined a teeming, heaving country that would become a player in their domestic drama."

We Recommend
And such drama! Frank blames Ellie for their boy's death and becomes obsessed with the son of the couple's domestic help. Umrigar loads her characters (especially Frank) with so much psychological baggage that it can be hard to emotionally connect with them. But like Ellie, who at one point abandons herself ecstatically to the music and dancing at the village Diwali festival, we're pulled along by the intensity of this sweepingly cinematic story.

When told that a lot of the characters in her new story collection, Don't Cry (Pantheon), seem angry, Mary Gaitskill professed disbelief to a Bookforum interviewer: " Really, you think that?... Who's angry here?"I'm sorry, but that's hilarious. In "A Dream of Men," a woman has thoughts and nightmares about people's heads and genitals being slashed—and not surprisingly, given what we learn about her. In " College Town, 1980," a romantically bereft woman drifts along in Ann Arbor, Michigan; she's been pulling out her hair. "She felt like the kind of retarded person who's smart enough to know she's retarded." In "The Little Boy," a woman bangs her fists on her forehead in the darkness of an airplane cabin as she broods about her grown daughters' remoteness and childlessness. Angry much? Nah!

We Recommend
Perhaps there are other, better words for these states: Regret. Sorrow. Despair. What's indisputable is that in five widely acclaimed books now over two decades (the earlier titles: Bad Behavior; Two Girls, Fat and Thin; Because They Wanted To; Veronica), Gaitskill has consistently plumbed the farther reaches of psychic extremis with power and passion. The rest is quibbling.Don't Cry has more structure than many story collections: Early on come character sketches and high-concept fragments that frequently pack the brutalist punch of A. M. Homes—scarcely plotted reveries that keep making you pull up and say, "Whoa." Later come more narratively coherent set pieces, ending with the long title story, in which a guilt-ridden widow accompanies a friend to Ethiopia in search of a child to adopt. All are rooted in a moral rage at the fact that morality as commonly understood is composed of simplistic and insipid falsehoods. No fairy tales for Mary!"Mary Gaitskill scares the hell out of me," an aspiring writer recently said to me. But as these savagely intelligent tales show, she also has a lot of heart—even if she might want to slap me for offering such tidy reassurance.

To say Joyce Carol Oates is prolific is like saying the Beatles wrote a few catchy tunes. The 1970 National Book Award winner (for Them) and Pulitzer Prize finalist has written more than 50 novels under her own name and several pseudonyms and has been published in Harper's, The New Yorker, and McSweeney's, among many other periodicals.Her latest volume, Dear Husband, (Ecco), comprises 14 character-driven short stories that range from the almost unimaginably tragic (the title story contains elements of the true-life tale of Andrea Yates, who drowned her five children in 2001; unlike her, Oates' protagonist, Lauri Lynn, then downs a handful of OxyContin in a halfhearted effort to end her misery) to the twistedbut- hilarious (in "Suicide by Fitness Center," a woman plots her self-destruction via treadmill and free weights).

We Recommend
It might be easy for Oates, whose work spans some 45 years, to lose a few steps, but she is still fresh as ever, not just cruising the postmillennial zeitgeist from the Iraq war to the BlackBerry but also finding new ways to illuminate the human condition, a skill that never loses relevance.The themes of guilt, regret, and unrequited love frequently pop up in these pages. In "Cutty Sark," a young man can't escape the shadow of his mom's tell-all memoir or his awareness of the mental illness that runs in their family. In "A Princeton Idyll," a woman learns that she is to blame for her well-respected grandfather's downfall as she corresponds with his former housekeeper. Dear Husband, like most of Oates' work, is vigorously dark, and it reminds us why we keep reading her in the first place: because we just can't turn away.

Women who write fiction about money and social status are routinely compared to Edith Wharton. This generally constitutes a grave case of mistaken identity, because the writers in question lack Wharton's tenderness and sense of tragedy—their narratives are mere travelogues through walk-in closets, their themes no more complex than the notion that the rich are bitchier than you and me. With a title likeSpoiled (Random House), you might expect Caitlin Macy's new story collection to be stocked with similarly campy sagas of shopping and revenge (and you might suspect that her publisher hopes fans of Gossip Girl will think so, too, and snap it up).But Macy—who wrote the widely admired novel The Fundamentals of Play (2000), which was an elegiac but mocking portrait of life after the Ivy League—is a writer Wharton herself might well approve of. While the trappings of wealth make their appearance—sharky, snarky mommies at the playground, bratty children, castles in Germany, ponies—Macy's true subject is conscience and how privilege shapes it, whether it belongs to the scholarship girl or the banker's wife. Her prose is tidy, assured, and graceful, and its restraint lends this book an old-fashioned clarity and confidence. "Still," she writes of a son of faded fortune, "whatever his problem, whatever the big bad family secret, it was just the slightly burned edge on a cake that everyone wanted to eat."

We Recommend
 Macy's insistence on turned tables and near comeuppances feels satisfyingly old-fashioned as well. In one tale, she turns a tense afternoon between an implacably self-satisfied teenage girl and her grizzled middle-aged riding coach into a slyly humorous class-warfare standoff; in
another, when a newly married, newly moneyed housewife finds herself envying the self-assurance that a red coat gives her Russian cleaning girl, she steals it. In the end, these stories aren't about money so much as they are about wanting, be it naked or sublimated, and about the
distance between anxious women and their resolutely logical, maddeningly literal-minded men—and that's what transmutes the book into an enjoyable read even for those of us who will never use the word summer as a verb.

Hints of Henry James inform the eight stories in Canadian writer Carol Windley's American debut, Home Schooling (Atlantic Monthly Press). Like that earlier master, Windley pays scrupulous attention to small, consequential gestures, to a sense of the uncanny that marks the proximity of characters to places and things, and as much to what goes unsaid as to what's spoken. Her tales emit moments of sudden radiance that unmask narrative mysteries while wrapping them ever more tightly around their outcomes."What Saffi Knows" (which echoes the James masterpiece "What Maisie Knew") is a chilling tale—set, like most of these stories, on Vancouver Island and in cities of the Pacific Northwest, and told in flashback from two decades further on—about a woman whose childhood innocence was lost right before her barely comprehending eyes, none of the adults in her young life ever having been privy to her inescapable witness. The opening lines of the astonishing title story are a high-wire act of narrative prestidigitation, mimicking the fault lines of memory and the compensatory gift of reinvention. "It began with three sisters who lived in a cottage beside the sea. Except the cottage wasn't beside the sea, it was some distance away, and it wasn't a cottage, it was an old farmhouse, and the farm was no longer a farm, it was a boarding school." Tragedy follows when a schoolboy drowns, bringing other sorrows in its wake.

We Recommend
"The Joy of Life," about how art imitates life and vice versa, spotlights a web of friendships, lovers, deceits, and dreads brought forth in a manner as lively and unpredictable as the "restless shadows [cast] along the walls" from the coal fire burning in the hearth in the room in Wales in which the story begins. Let's hope that Windley's novel, Breathing Under Water, and a previous story collection, Visible Light, both of which have yet to be published in the United States, follow this book of pure magic, pronto.

Those wondering whether the spirit of bohemian anarchy endures in today's hunkered-down Red America need look only as far as the marvelously reliable Wichita, Kansas, native Antonya Nelson's latest story collection, Nothing Right (Bloomsbury). As in three novels and five story collections preceding (including Female Trouble and Some Fun), Nelson, 47, who teaches in Houston and in Las Cruces, New Mexico, delivers convincing portraits—11 of them here—of folk who are alarmingly drinking-positive, more than a little familiar with illicit drugs, and all too conversant in the language of infidelity.We watch families bounce over and past tragic and chance events—wrecked cars, unplanned pregnancies, broken marriages—cobbling together emotional lives and existential alibis as they go. In "Falsetto," a young woman manages to lie to her boyfriend moments after learning of her mother's death in order to rid herself of his suddenly unbearable presence. In "DWI," a woman has an affair with her little brother's troubled, doomed friend Sebastian and then watches her own hidden torrent of emotions play out on the face of her five-year-old son when he's told he'll never see Sebastian again.

We Recommend
Only one querulous quibble arose in my male breast as I devoured these sordid, cynical, and supremely romantic tales: All the men here suck. Where Nelson used to indulge boyish guys with Jeff Bridges–like charm, now we find only losers, liars, cheaters, and sociopaths. It's almost as if the author, who in her narratives resolutely stays this side of the nearest interstate, were fed up with a certain out-of-control macho mentality recently abroad in the wider world. Here's hoping she soon recovers her winning sense of man-humor.

Yiyun Li is living the American writer's dream. Born in Beijing in 1972, she came to the United States to study medicine at the University of Iowa. She felt out of touch with her parents and boyfriend (now husband) back home, so she took a writing class. Li was smitten, as were her teachers, and after getting an immunology degree she earned a coveted spot in Iowa's MFA writing program. Her stories were soon published in The New Yorker and The Paris Review, and her collection of stories about contemporary Chinese life, A Thousand Years of Good Prayers (2005), was showered with praise and awards. Now Li has poured her prodigious talent into The Vagrants (Random House), her powerful debut novel about the people in the modest Chinese city of Muddy River in 1979—the year in which, Li tells me on the phone, "China first started to open up to the world." The story centers on the public
execution of a young woman who had served in China's fanatical Red Guard before renouncing Communism. This horrific event is regarded by the jaded citizenry merely as a break from the daily grind: "Two day-care teachers were hurrying 12 small children to join the parade, their hands holding a rope with its two ends in the teachers' hands." (At the age of five, Li attended the public execution of a "counterrevolutionary hooligan," and she tells me she herself stood in that line.) The repercussions of the spectacle are overwhelming for everyone in the novel, including two bereft elderly couples, a conflicted female propagandist, a sleazy braggart, a forsaken young girl, and even a schoolboy and his dog.

We Recommend
Familiarity with Chinese history isn't at all necessary to relate to the grief, pain, confusion, fear, loyalty, suspicion, and love portrayed by the characters in this deeply affecting story. "Every time there is political turmoil, people turn against each other," Li says. Now a writing professor at University of California at Davis, Li says that when it comes to writing, English is her native tongue, and The Vagrants has a confident, democratic style that gives a distinct voice to every character. "Growing up in China, you learn you can never trust one person's words," Li says. "People's stories don't always match." But one thing is clear: Li's stories matter.

In Blonde Roots (Riverhead), her first prose novel (after three in verse), Bernardine Evaristo boldly turns history on its head, recasting Africans as rich, powerful slave owners and Europeans as their hapless chattel. Doris Scagglethorpe, a poor "whyte" woman on a cabbage farm in feudal England, is kidnapped while playing hide-andseek with her sisters and shipped to the New World of Great Ambossa, where she is renamed Omorenomwara and stripped of her clothing, her customs, and her freedom. Writing from Doris' point of view, with a detour into the mind of her formidable master, Chief Kaga Konata Katamba I (aka "Bwana"), Evaristo
vividly depicts the dehumanizing, soulshrinking effects of unchecked power over others. A Brit of partly Nigerian descent, Evaristo also has fun
with details: City names include Londolo and Goatsherd Bush, and the whyte slaves who toil on the plantations speak in a thick patois. Doris is a smart, plucky heroine, and we fervently root for her to make a break for freedom, even at the risk of her life.

We Recommend
 Evaristo makes an earnest and honorable attempt via racial rolereversal to freshly evoke the horrors of human bondage. But what makes other fictions
about slavery (notably Toni Morrison's Beloved) more gut-wrenching than a satire like this could be is their focus on our common humanity, our perseverance in the face of suffering and loss, our attachments to family, and our abiding need to live as free individuals—regardless of our race.

How many of us would relish the chance to sit down for a chat with our 14-year-old self? The accomplished British writer Ali Smith (Hotel World, The Accidental) imagines just that in "Writ," one of the most deftly moving tales in The First Person and Other Stories (Pantheon), a collection brimming with poetic whimsy.In a story called "The Child," a grocery store customer finds a toddler in her shopping cart and ends up stuck as his caretaker, reluctantly charmed by him until sexist and politically abhorrent jokes begin to "slip out of his rubyred mouth." Many stories here—such as "Astute Fiery Luxurious," about a couple that receives a misaddressed parcel and obsesses over what to do—are so densely layered with their characters' recollections and introspection that it's hard to say what a given story is about, but quite easy to find a resonant chord.

We Recommend
In "The Third Person," a nonlinear assemblage of a couple dozen disjointed mini stories separated by seasons—showcasing a fluidity and simplicity of narrative—Smith writes about lovers in a doomed union: "Their time as a couple is nearly up, the man knows, because he has seen how the woman has begun to despise him.... [W]hen he was cutting courgettes into strips for a stir-fry, he saw it cross her face. He feels that the end of their love must be something to do with the way he cuts vegetables." Smith's writing does sometimes veer into dreamy, metaphorical territory, as in the title story, in which the narrator compares her and her partner's love to a wooden table left outside to face certain rot. But for the most part these tales are vibrant and poignant, as though deconstructing our
compulsion to connect with one another were as easy as writing a story.

If I could name one novel by an American woman that compares in cult status to J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye or Jack Kerouac'sOn the Road, it would be Jayne Anne Phillips' Black Tickets. A short masterpiece comprising connected tales about people living outside the American Dream that Raymond Carver praised for its "crooked beauty," Phillips' 1979 debut heralded a writer of precocious power and daring instincts. Her work since—including Machine Dreams, Fast Lanes, Shelter, and Motherkind—has proven, and even surpassed, her early promise.A West Virginia native who now directs Rutgers University's MFA program in Newark, New Jersey, Phillips has never abandoned her writerly vow to illuminate the hearts and minds of the marginalized, the outliers, the disenfranchised—whether by education, geography, economics, or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps.Her latest work, Lark & Termite (Knopf), her first in nine years, is set in West Virginia and Korea in the 1950s. At its center are two siblings, 17-year-old Lark and her brother, Termite, who is mute and cannot walk; their fragile mother, Lola; their aunt Nonie, who is raising them; and Termite's father, Corporal Robert Leavitt, who is serving in the Korean War.

We Recommend
Moving between Leavitt's perilous situation—his unit has taken refuge with some South Koreans in a railroad tunnel after being pinned down by friendly fire—and his hardscrabble family in Winfield, West Virginia, where a life-changing natural disaster strikes, Phillips lovingly and dramatically captures intimate and historic parallels between these disparate places.In one startling passage, Lark says about Termite, as they sit in the yard of Nonie's house in the "still and flat" day, "He never looks at his fingers but I always think he hears or knows something through them." It seems to me that Phillips has always written this way too—right through her amazing fingers into the astonished world.

Miriam Toews became a literary sensation in Canada in 2004 when her third novel, A Complicated Kindness, spent a year on best-seller lists and earned several literary honors. About a rebellious teenage girl in a Mennonite community who dreams of running off to hang out with Lou Reed, the book was keyed to Toews' signature themes: headlong nonconformism (she herself is of Mennonite heritage), an intimate understanding of dysfunctional family dynamics, and a mercurial bohemian free-spiritedness reminiscent of writers like Anne Lamott.Whereas your typical Russian Mennonite colony in Manitoba is not the stuff of American publishers' fondest dreams, Counterpoint has high hopes for Toews' latest novel, The Flying Troutmans, which plays out more or less as if Little Miss Sunshine were, well, a Lou Reed song instead of a Sundance-fave indie flick."Yeah, so things have fallen apart," begins Hattie Troutman, 28. Freshly dumped by a cad in Paris, she has flown home to Manitoba on the news that her sister, Min, has had another psychotic break. Charged with caring for her 15-year old nephew, Logan, who's been expelled from school, and her 11-year-old niece, Thebes, of whom far too much holding-things-together has been asked, Hattie realizes that she's in danger of losing custody of them. So they pack up the Ford Aerostar and head out to find the kids' errant dad—a quest that leads them to Murdo, South Dakota, and points southward, all the way to a tented anarchist encampment on the California-Mexico border.This saga of bad luck and good company is a wry, scary, heartfelt ode to the traverses we have to make in life when we're at the end of our rope and there's no net below us.

Set in the American colonies in the late 1600s, Toni Morrison's new novella, A Mercy (Knopf), depicts an unforgiving world in which Europeans, indentured servants, Native Americans, free blacks, and slaves must depend on one another for survival and companionship. With nuance, empathy, and authority, Morrison tests these families-of-necessity against the irrefutable bonds of blood, caste, and faith. In the process, she evokes the atmosphere in which the country's "peculiar institution" of chattel slavery took root.Morrison returns to the theme of salvation through sacrifice previously explored in her Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, Beloved. This time, however, rather than killing her child to spare her a life of enslavement, a mother urges her daughter, Florens, upon an Anglo-Dutch trader as payment for her master's debt. As Florens' mother later reveals, "I saw the tall man see you as a human child, not pieces of eight"—a better fate than remaining with a master who saw the prepubescent girl as almost ripe for the plucking. But this tragic calculus is never communicated to Florens, who spends her young life searching for a remedy for her abandonment.

We Recommend
One solution comes in the form of a brief love affair with a free African blacksmith. Skilled in traditional healing arts, he also knows a possible cure for the smallpox that first kills the trader and then afflicts his widow. When the blacksmith unexpectedly disappears, the mistress wants him back as badly as does Florens: "For her it is to save her life. For me it is to have one." The story alternates between Florens' search for him and the fortunes of the ailing mistress and her servants, who recognize that "three unmastered women and an infant out here, alone, belonging to no one, became wild game for anyone." Morrison's exhumation of the past reveals how slaves and masters were not born but wrought by economic forces, fear of difference, and the instinct for sheer self-preservation.

After scoring two much-ballyhooed home runs in the '90s with She's Come Undone and I Know This Much Is True, Oprah-anointed novelist Wally Lamb is finally sauntering back to the plate with his 700-plus-page third novel, The Hour I First Believed (Harper). Lamb seems to have spent much of the decade conjuring up calamities to inflict upon his hapless punching bag of a protagonist, Caelum Quirk, a hard-drinking "emotional castrato" (as wife No. 2 put it) with a sad family history. The story is stuffed with ripped-from the-headlines disasters, from the Columbine High School massacre of 1999 through 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, ending, more or less, with the Iraq war.Caelum, an English teacher, and his third wife, Maureen, a school nurse, were both employed at the infamous school when teen terrorists Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold unleashed their ammunition and their fury. Caelum happened to be away, dealing with the death of a relative, but gentle Maureen got caught up in the chaos. Although she escapes unharmed, she never recovers from the psychological trauma of it. The couple's nightmare has just begun.

We Recommend
Maureen isn't the only one with PTSD: Lamb's focus on the violent instability of modern life ("We lived, lulled, on the fault line of chaos. Change could come explosively, and out of nowhere," Caelum observes) seems intended to make us understand that we are all collaterally damaged. In the aftermath of Columbine, Caelum wanders through a maze of emotional twists and turns in a lifelong quest for meaning and peace. Lamb, a maestro of orchestrating emotion, yanks our heartstrings until they nearly snap, but also knows how to make his fans' hearts sing.

What is it about prestigious secondary schools and sordid scandals, anyway? In Testimony (Little, Brown), the latest—and definitely most salacious—novel by best-selling writer Anita Shreve (The Pilot's Wife, The Weight of Water), New England's Avery Academy erupts into a hotbed of rumor and recrimination when four of its students (three testosterone-and-brewsky-fueled star athletes and a freshman blond) star in an XXX-worthy video that falls into the hands of their headmaster (who is all too soon to headline in a scandal of his own, as it turns out) and later pops up on almost every laptop on campus.Assuredly more complicated than an episode of Gossip Girl (and with far less backstabbing), Shreve's suspenseful tale anatomizes the emotions of parents, teenage classmates, a newspaper reporter, and even the grown-up buyer of the booze in question, to name a few, until it's all but impossible to assign blame to the event. Was the 14-year-old blond looking for trouble? Was a mom discovered to be in her own compromising position the reason a good-natured goody-goody abandoned his moral principles? To whom does it fall to discipline a headmaster? And the question that trumps them all: Does assigning blame even really matter?Shreve doesn't sift through her characters' ethical dilemmas in order to point fingers, or to wag them. Instead, she's out to show how one foolish deviation on the part of seemingly well-intentioned people can snowball into a headline-making tragedy that derails the lives of all involved.

"It is the blight man was born for/ It is Margaret you mourn for." Gerard Manley Hopkins' nineteenth-century poem about lost innocence, the epigraph of Francine Prose's fifteenth novel,Goldengrove (Harper), sets the tone for her quietly devastating portrait of a grieving family. Here, Margaret is the elder of two teenage daughters, a charismatic stunner who, just before heading off to college, drowns in the lake in front of their home. The rest of the story, told by Margaret's 13-year-old sister, Nico, spans a summer in which family members stumble around and into each other, trying to figure out how to live without their golden girl.Nico adored everything about Margaret: her love of old films and songs, her vintage clothes, even her scent ("like cookies baking...I was the pudgy, awkward sister. I still smelled dusty, like a kid"). To her parents' dismay, Nico also adores Margaret's indie-god boyfriend, Aaron, who is shattered by the death. In an attempt to return to normalcy, Nico and Aaron bond, doing the things they did with Margaret—watching movies, eating ice cream. "Maybe it was possible to decontaminate certain activities, the way flood victims wash the silt off family treasures and set them back on the mantel," Nico rationalizes as their clandestine rendezvous flame into unhealthy obsession. But while Nico and Aaron may cross the line, Prose, a keen chronicler of human emotion, doesn't, either in her restrained description of their charged relationship or in her sympathetic portrayal of those left flailing in Margaret's wake. Our hearts go out to Nico, a naive and utterly un-Gilmore-ish girl. As we watch her struggle simultaneously with coming of age and coming to terms with loss, we mourn, but we also have faith that she'll find her own way.

In her latest dispatches on popular history, The Wordy Shipmates (Riverhead), Sarah Vowell, best-selling author (Assassination Vacation, The Partly Cloudy Patriot) and contributor to public radio's This American Life, examines—and somehow channels for us, to our lasting amusement—her favorite Massachusetts Bay colony Puritans: Johns Winthrop and Cotton and exiles Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson. Though much of the narrative line is lifted from Winthrop's writings (and is at times overly detailed if your ardor for the visionary diarist doesn't match Vowell's), her entertaining gloss on the 1620 settlers' struggle between humility before God and the egomania that comes with being God's chosen is leavened by her modern-day tours of the Mohegan Sun casino and a Mayflower-themed waterslide. For those of us who'd rather harvest our history lessons from The Simpsons than the History Channel, Vowell is a latter-day hero.What's most fascinating here is watching how America's first settlers—upon arriving more than 100 years before the American Revolutionary generation was born—began to embrace democratic ideas even as they clung to faith in predestination and providence, most famously Winthrop in his "city on a hill" speech, which was invoked a few times by Catholic (gasp!) JFK and then by Ronald Reagan almost ad nauseam. Fast-forward to 2008, and Vowell handily helps us identify with the essential question that propelled the colonists all the way to the New World: What if our country is destroying itself?

Daphne Beal's delicately drawn debut novel, In the Land of No Right Angles (Anchor), starts out as "a little adventure...an adventure tagged onto an adventure" high in the hills above Kathmandu and swiftly and assuredly becomes an unpredictable journey of the spirit and the flesh. From that alluring city, 20-year-old Alex, an American student spending a year in Nepal, sets out on one of her solo treks into the mist-shrouded Himalayas.While following her passion for photographing this remote land, Alex also accepts a request from Will, an American friend, to seek out a young Nepalese woman named Maya, whose future may be in jeopardy. Beal, who has lived in both India and Nepal, writes that Maya means "`love' in Nepali, `magic' in Hindi, `illusion' in Sanskrit, and is also the name of the Buddha's mother." This early passage is like a hiker's cairn marking the pathway into Beal's enchanting, at times perilous, tale of love, magic, and illusion, as an intimate triangle of circumstances, secrets, and desires develops among Alex, Maya, and Will.

We Recommend
With steady, cinematic pacing, Beal moves between Nepal, New York City, and Bombay's gritty red-light district, Falkland Road, where Alex goes one night to visit with and photograph some locals she has befriended on an unexpected quest there. "Outside," Beal writes, "we all waited in the lavender light of dusk, where everything seemed to float a few inches above the ground"—like this fine first book does.

As a literary trope, the May–December marriage has typically served as a heroine's great fear, punishment, or indignity. In her strikingly unconventional new novel, The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), narrated by a woman 30 years younger than her spouse, Rebecca Miller turns the cliché; on its head. Pippa Lee has spent her adult life slavishly doting on her publisher husband, Herb, and their two children. But when Herb turns 80 and moves the pair into a retirement community, Pippa begins to dwell on her youth, when she was a Warholian muse, a runaway junkie who attached herself to people with an excess of talent, experience, or perversity: "[L]ike a wolf domesticated by humans, I caught a scent of my old ways and felt hemmed in." At the same time that she's becoming increasingly aware of Herb's mortality, Pippa starts having unsettling sleepwalking episodes that keep leading her to her neighbor's adult son. At first, Pippa thinks she's going crazy, but eventually she realizes she's waking up to a new phase of her life.

We Recommend
 Miller, who is married to Daniel Day Lewis and is Arthur Miller's daughter, was a painter before she turned to film; she wrote and directed The Ballad of Jack and Rose and a movie version of her story collection, Personal Velocity, and she is doing the same with Pippa Lee (due next year, with Robin Wright Penn, Alan Arkin, and Keanu Reeves in the lead roles).A much quieter, more intimate look at a marriage's inner workings is offered up by Glenda Burgess in her moving debut memoir, The Geography of Love (Broadway). Like the fictional Pippa, Burgess married a man who surpassed her in years (13) and corporate rank, and she took naturally to the role of devoted wife and mother. The couple enjoyed a passionate courtship, and Burgess shows us how they managed to sustain their romance through the years. Then, just when it all seems too good to be true, their lives are shattered when Ken, a healthy athlete in his fifties, is diagnosed with lung cancer. With her mother also wasting away from the same disease, Burgess draws upon Ken's lessons of courage and optimism in order to become the family's rock. Both Burgess' tender recollections and Miller's more pragmatic imaginings remind us that we tend to be defined by our great loves well after we have outlived them.

Playing for KeepsThe Garden of Last Days (Norton), Andre Dubus III's stout but sleek, not to mention compelling, new book, is the author's first in the nine years since he produced his bestselling tour de force, House of Sand and Fog. Inspired by the odd detail buried in the post-9/11 news coverage that some of the hijackers of that day visited strip clubs where they drank and caroused in the weeks before they guided the airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Dubus' novel asks why these jihadis would so brazenly flout Islamic law and risk distraction or even detection by participating in such forbidden activities especially when they believed they were just days away from cavorting with virgins in heaven. What might have been the repercussions of these tawdry but insignificant acts in light of the devastation to come?Dubus explores with his formidable gifts of empathy the lives and motivations of a motley cast of strangers linked only by their association with the Puma Club for Men on Florida's Gulf Coast (near where the real-life hijackers are known to have convened). There's April, a single mom whose stripper name is Spring; Lonnie, a bouncer with a soft heart and a steel fist; A.J., a down-on-his-luck construction worker who is dangerously infatuated with a girl at the club; and Bassam, a mysterious "rich little foreigner" who has been sneaking away from his Middle Eastern coconspirators in order to catch a last glimpse of Spring. When her three-year-old daughter disappears from the club one night in late-August 2001 while mom is working, everyone is suddenly implicated. Although we know how Bassamrs's story will soon turn out, and he remains to the end a bit of a cipher, Dubus keeps us anxiously wondering how many of the other characters will likewise be destroyed by a misguided but inescapable sense of duty.

 A Tale of Two CitiesThe Enchantress of Florence (Random House), Salman Rushdie's eleventh work of fiction, is a beguiling, incandescent tale of travel, treachery, and transformation set in the Renaissance Florence of Machiavelli and the Medicis and in India's Mughal Empire. Written in Rushdie's signature plummy style, the story opens with the arrival of a trickster, "a yellow haired liar" named Mogor dell'Amore, in the capital city of Emperor Akbar the Great's kingdom. Drawn from his home by a secret that will "make his fortune or cost him his life," the fleet-tongued traveler mesmerizes the emperor and his court with the story of a mysterious Indian woman who herself survived a near-impossible journey to Florence to become its enchantress, and the novel's lavish, lascivious muse.While Mogor's risky quest and fate are central to this dazzlingly intricate and convoluted novel, Rushdie ushers in a caravan of low, laughable characters in the service of his weighty and witty observations on religion, politics, sex, war, art, philosophy, and science in an East-West world of white mischief and black magic, of enigmatic nightmares and inscrutable dreams.For Rushdie, the celebrated author of, among many other titles, The Satanic Verses, which led Muslim religious leaders to call for his death, the dangers inherent in the art of storytelling underpin this prodigious fever dream of a book. As Akbar warns Mogor in one scene, "The Hindustani storyteller always knows when he loses his audience...because the audience simply gets up and leaves, or else it throws vegetables, or, if the audience is the king, it occasionally throws the storyteller headfirst off the city ramparts." Heathers and Hidalgos
We all have our high school horror stories. Maybe only by senior year (if at all) do we feel we've found our place—which is exactly when Milagro Marquez, the heroine in Liza Monroy's debut novel, Mexican High (Spiegel & Grau), has to move schools, and countries, because her mother is a U.S. diplomat. So Mila exchanges Washington, DC, for Mexico City (the ninth place she's lived in her 16 years), enrolling at the International School of Mexico, a $40,000-a-year academy serving the highest echelons of Mexican society and the offspring of foreign professionals.At ISM, wealthy, light-skinned fresas (the Gossip Girls of the south-of-the-border set) rule and disdain the gringas. While the freethinking Mila couldn't care less about the pecking order in this overheated, undersupervised social scene, in short order she is forced to confront a whole menu of teen traumas—sexual assaults, drugs, nervous breakdowns. Then there's the issue of her dad, a married Mexican politician whom her mother refuses to identify even though they're back at the scene of the crime, so to speak. Monroy, whose own coming-of-age—surprise! closely tracks Mila's, marvelously captures modern Mexico City, from the perpetual smog that obscures the stars to the frenetic pace in the touristy downtown Zona Rosa. Through Mila's eyes, we see anew that bad things happen to good people; that we all make poor choices but get some do-overs; and that the growing pains of these years can be excruciating but also liberating.

Playing for KeepsThe Garden of Last Days (Norton), Andre Dubus III's stout but sleek, not to mention compelling, new book, is the author's first in the nine years since he produced his bestselling tour de force, House of Sand and Fog. Inspired by the odd detail buried in the post-9/11 news coverage that some of the hijackers of that day visited strip clubs where they drank and caroused in the weeks before they guided the airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Dubus' novel asks why these jihadis would so brazenly flout Islamic law and risk distraction or even detection by participating in such forbidden activities especially when they believed they were just days away from cavorting with virgins in heaven. What might have been the repercussions of these tawdry but insignificant acts in light of the devastation to come?Dubus explores with his formidable gifts of empathy the lives and motivations of a motley cast of strangers linked only by their association with the Puma Club for Men on Florida's Gulf Coast (near where the real-life hijackers are known to have convened). There's April, a single mom whose stripper name is Spring; Lonnie, a bouncer with a soft heart and a steel fist; A.J., a down-on-his-luck construction worker who is dangerously infatuated with a girl at the club; and Bassam, a mysterious "rich little foreigner" who has been sneaking away from his Middle Eastern coconspirators in order to catch a last glimpse of Spring. When her three-year-old daughter disappears from the club one night in late-August 2001 while mom is working, everyone is suddenly implicated. Although we know how Bassamrs's story will soon turn out, and he remains to the end a bit of a cipher, Dubus keeps us anxiously wondering how many of the other characters will likewise be destroyed by a misguided but inescapable sense of duty.
